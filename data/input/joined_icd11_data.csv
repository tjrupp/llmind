• No single physical feature or personality type is common to all individuals with disorders
of intellectual development, although specific etiological groups may have common
physical characteristics.
• Disorders of intellectual development are associated with a high rate of co-occurring
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, clinical presentations
may vary depending on the individual’s age, level of severity of the disorder of intellectual
development, communication skills and symptom complexity. Some disorders – such
as autism spectrum disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar and related disorders,
schizophrenia, dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – occur more
commonly among individuals with disorders of intellectual development than in the

• Problem or challenging behaviours such as aggression, self-injurious behaviour, attention-
seeking behaviour, oppositional defiant behaviour and sexually inappropriate behaviour
are more frequent among those with disorders of intellectual development than in the

• Many individuals with disorders of intellectual development are more gullible and naive,
easier to deceive, and more prone to acquiescence and confabulation than people in the

of victimization, becoming involved in criminal activities and providing inaccurate

Loss of previously acquired skills
A small proportion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder may present with a loss of
previously acquired skills. This regression typically occurs during the second year of life and most
often involves language use and social responsiveness. Loss of previously acquired skills is rarely
observed after 3 years of age. If it occurs after age 3, it is more likely to involve loss of cognitive and
adaptive skills (e.g. loss of bowel and bladder control, impaired sleep), regression of language and
social abilities, and increasing emotional and behavioural disturbances.

to as “shared or induced delusional disorder” or “folie-à-deux”. In such cases, one person
typically adopts the delusional belief of the other person, and the delusions may remit in
the less dominant person when the two individuals are separated.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• A continuum of delusional beliefs, attenuated delusional beliefs, overvalued ideas, and
unusual or eccentric beliefs has been observed in the general population. Such beliefs may
be more common among people under conditions of adversity. People with delusional
disorder may display greater psychological distress, greater preoccupation and a higher
degree of conviction compared to people in the general population with beliefs that are
similar in nature to beliefs that could be characterized as delusional.

during the late teen years, onset of bipolar type I disorder can occur at any time through
the life-cycle, including in older adulthood. Late-onset mood symptoms may be more
likely to be caused by the effects of medications or substances or other medical conditions.

recurrent mood episodes. More than half of manic episodes will be immediately followed
by a depressive episode.
• The risk of recurrence of mood episodes in bipolar type I disorder increases with the
number of prior mood episodes.

Course features for bipolar type II disorder
• Bipolar type II disorder has its onset most often during the mid-20s; however, onset during
late adolescence and throughout early and mid-adulthood may also occur. Initial onset of
bipolar type II disorder in older adults is rare.
• While onset typically begins following a single depressive episode, some individuals
experience several depressive episodes before occurrence of a hypomanic episode.
• The presence of chronic and gradually worsening experiences of affective lability or mood
swings, particularly during adolescence and early adulthood, has been associated with an
increased risk of developing bipolar type II disorder.
• Up to 15% of individuals with bipolar type II disorder will subsequently develop a manic
episode, resulting in a change of diagnosis to bipolar type I disorder.
• Spontaneous intra-episode shifts from a depressive episode to a hypomanic episode are
not uncommon.
• Risk of recurrence increases with each subsequent mood episode.
Sex- and/or gender-related features for bipolar type II disorder
• Women are more likely to experience hypomanic episodes, mixed episodes and rapid
cycling. The time of greatest risk of a hypomanic episode is during the early postpartum
period following childbirth. Approximately half of those who experience postpartum
hypomanic symptoms will later develop a depressive disorder. Differentiating between

Additional clinical features
• Any part of the body may be the focus of the perceived flaws or defects, but the most
common area is the face (especially the skin, nose, hair, eyes, teeth, lips, chin or overall facial
appearance). However, there are frequently multiple perceived defects. Usually, the focal
feature is regarded as flawed, defective, asymmetrical, too big/small or disproportionate,
or the complaint may be of thinning hair, acne, wrinkles, scars, vascular markings, pallor
or ruddiness of complexion, or insufficient muscularity. Sometimes the preoccupation is
vague or consists of a general perception of ugliness or being “not right” or being too
masculine/feminine.
• Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder, can place affected individuals –
usually males – at increased risk of complications requiring medical attention (e.g. muscle
tears, strains, side-effects of steroid use).
• The risk of suicide in adolescents and adults with body dysmorphic disorder is high,
particularly when depressive symptomatology co-occurs. Owing to the low base
rate occurrence of attempted and completed suicide, it is difficult to predict suicidal
behaviours. Factors to consider in assessing risk include previous attempts, lack of
perceived psychosocial support, perception of burdensomeness and hopelessness. It
is also important to consider that identification of body dysmorphic disorder may be
especially challenging because the increased occurrence of shame and perceived stigma
among affected individuals often leads them to conceal their difficulties, or to present
with symptoms of depressive disorders, social anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive
disorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder.
• The diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder is typically made based on direct observation
or physical examination of the perceived body flaws or defects. If this is not possible
because it is inappropriate, or the individual refuses to remove their camouflage, then it
may be difficult to make a judgement about how noticeable or abnormal a perceived defect

Additional clinical features
• The diagnosis of olfactory reference disorder partly depends on determining whether
there is evidence of the odour reported by the individual. A variety of other medical and
dental conditions can be associated with unpleasant odours (e.g. periodontal disease,
trimethylaminuria), and these underlying causes should be ruled out, particularly if the
odour is detectable even if slight. However, the perceived odour may vary in intensity,
or the individual may be unable or unwilling to remove camouflaging odours (e.g.
perfume), which may make it difficult to judge how noticeable the odour is. In such cases,
corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informant or physician
who has conducted a physical examination of the individual.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Fear of emitting offensive odours is, to some extent, common in many cultures. However,
olfactory reference disorder can be differentiated from normal concerns by the degree
of preoccupation and frequency of related recurrent behaviours performed, as well
as the degree of distress or interference the individual experiences as a consequence of
these symptoms.

Additional clinical features
• Assessment for the diagnosis of hoarding disorder may require obtaining additional
information beyond self-report, such as reports from collateral informants or visual
inspection of clutter in the home.
• Generally, items are hoarded because of their emotional significance (e.g. association with
a significant event, person, place or time), instrumental characteristics (e.g. perceived
usefulness) or intrinsic value (e.g. perceived aesthetic qualities).
• Individuals with hoarding disorder may be unable to find important items (e.g. bills,
tax forms), circulate easily inside their home, or even exit their home in the event of an
emergency. Ability to prepare food, use sinks or home appliances (e.g. refrigerator, stove,
washing machine) or furniture (e.g. sofas, chairs, beds, tables) may also be compromised.
• Individuals with hoarding disorder may experience a range of chronic medical problems,
such as obesity, and are exposed to various environmental risks often caused by their
hoarding behaviour, including fire hazards, injuries from falling, contamination by rotting
perishable foods, and allergies from contact with dust pollen and bacteria.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Collectors acquire many items that they report being attached to and are reluctant to
discard. However, they are also more targeted in their acquisitions (e.g. confining their
acquisitions to a narrow range of items), more selective (e.g. planning and purchasing
only predetermined items), more likely to organize their possessions, and less likely to
accumulate items in an excessive manner.

There is persistent preoccupation with the distressing symptoms and their consequences (e.g., the individual spends more than an hour a day thinking about them), typically associated with frequent medical visits. The person devotes much of his or her energy to focusing on the symptoms and their consequences. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation cause moderate impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., relationship conflict, performance problems at work, abandonment of a range of social and leisure activities).
For this disease the diagnostical requirements are: Moderate bodily distress disorder

Additional clinical features
• The most common bodily symptoms associated with bodily distress disorder include
pain (e.g. musculoskeletal pain, backache, headaches), fatigue, and gastrointestinal and
respiratory symptoms, although patients may be preoccupied with any bodily symptoms.
The individual can generally provide a detailed description of the symptoms, but it may be
difficult for clinicians to account for the symptoms in anatomical or physiological terms.
• Individuals with bodily distress disorder often over-interpret or catastrophize about their
bodily symptoms, and dwell on their most extreme negative consequences. For example,
in more severe cases, pain or fatigue may be perceived as being so intense that they prevent
normal activities, despite there being no medical basis for such a belief. This is often
accompanied by fear of triggering pain or an exacerbation of other symptoms, which may
lead to undue avoidance of activities; this may in turn lead to other symptoms associated
with inactivity (e.g. stiffness and muscle weakness, muscle pain following minimal
exertion).
• Individuals with bodily distress disorder may hold a range of attributions regarding their
symptoms, including psychological and physical explanations. As severity increases,
affected individuals are more likely to reject psychological explanations for their symptoms.
Some individuals with bodily distress disorder believe that their bodily symptoms indicate
underlying physical illness or injury (i.e. disease conviction), even though this has not
been detected. Insistence that the symptoms are caused by an undiagnosed illness or

• Some symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal – such as autonomic
hyperactivity, anxiety and insomnia – can recur or persist for several months after
abstinence, particularly when the person is exposed to alcohol-associated cues
(a conditioned withdrawal state). The presence of such persisting symptoms is not
sufficient to meet diagnostic requirements for alcohol withdrawal.

Additional features
• The occurrence, severity and duration of cannabis withdrawal vary according to the
type and potency of the cannabis preparation, as well as the amount, frequency and
duration of use before cessation or reduction of use.
• Onset of cannabis withdrawal typically occurs at some point between 12 hours and

• If symptoms and consequences of gaming behaviour are severe (e.g. gaming behaviours
persist for days at a time without respite or have major effects on functioning or health)
and all other diagnostic requirements are met, it may be appropriate to assign a diagnosis
of gaming disorder following a period that is briefer than 12 months (e.g. 6 months).
• Individuals with gaming disorder may make numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or
significantly reduce gaming behaviour, whether self-initiated or imposed by others.
• Individuals with gaming disorder may increase the duration or frequency of gaming
behaviour over time, or experience a need to engage in games of increasing levels of
complexity or requiring increasing skills or strategy in an effort to maintain or exceed
previous levels of excitement, or to avoid boredom.
• Individuals with gaming disorder often experience urges or cravings to engage in gaming
during other activities.
• Upon cessation or reduction of gaming behaviour, often imposed by others, individuals
with gaming disorder may experience dysphoria and exhibit adversarial behaviour or
verbal or physical aggression.
• Individuals with gaming disorder may exhibit substantial disruptions in diet, sleep, exercise
and other health-related behaviours that can result in negative physical and mental health
outcomes, particularly if there are very extended periods of gaming.
• High-intensity gaming behaviour may occur as a part of online computer games that
involve coordination among multiple users to accomplish complex tasks. In these cases,
peer-group dynamics may contribute to the maintenance of intensive gaming behaviours.
Regardless of the social contributions to the behaviour, the diagnosis of gaming disorder
may still be applied if all diagnostic requirements are met.
• Gaming disorder commonly co-occurs with disorders due to substance use, mood
disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder and sleep-wake disorders.

with gaming disorder may experience dysphoria and exhibit adversarial behaviour or
verbal or physical aggression.
• Individuals with gaming disorder may exhibit substantial disruptions in diet, sleep, exercise
and other health-related behaviours that can result in negative physical and mental health
outcomes, particularly if there are very extended periods of gaming.
• High-intensity gaming behaviour may occur as a part of online computer games that
involve coordination among multiple users to accomplish complex tasks. In these cases,
peer-group dynamics may contribute to the maintenance of intensive gaming behaviours.
Regardless of the social contributions to the behaviour, the diagnosis of gaming disorder
may still be applied if all diagnostic requirements are met.
• Gaming disorder commonly co-occurs with disorders due to substance use, mood
disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder and sleep-wake disorders.

• Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder may be part of a delinquent peer group where
delinquent activities are often conducted in association with peers. This may be particularly
common among those with adolescent onset.
• The relationship between conduct-dissocial disorder and oppositional defiant disorder has
historically been conceptualized as hierarchical and developmental in nature, with conduct-
dissocial disorder generally considered more severe than, and commonly preceded by,
oppositional defiant disorder. However, conduct-dissocial disorder frequently co-occurs
and can be diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, particularly among individuals
with a more persistent history of behaviour problems.
• Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions (see
p. 548) and individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, childhood onset, are at greater
risk of exhibiting a more persistent and severe pattern of antisocial behaviour over time.

The core feature of the detachment trait domain is the tendency to maintain interpersonal distance
(social detachment) and emotional distance (emotional detachment). Common manifestations
of detachment, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include
the following.
Social detachment
Social detachment is characterized by avoidance of social interactions, lack of friendships and
avoidance of intimacy. Individuals with prominent detachment do not enjoy social interactions,
and avoid all kinds of social contact and social situations as far as possible. They engage in little to
no “small talk”, even if initiated by others (e.g. at store check-out counters), seek out employment
that does not involve interactions with others, and even refuse promotions if these would entail
more interaction with others. They have few to no friends or even casual acquaintances. Their
interactions with family members tend to be minimal and superficial. They rarely, if ever, engage
in any intimate relationships, and are not particularly interested in sexual relations.
Emotional detachment
Emotional detachment is characterized by reserve, aloofness and limited emotional expression
and experience. Individuals with prominent detachment keep to themselves as far as possible,
even in obligatory social situations. They are typically aloof, responding to direct attempts at
social engagement only briefly and in ways that discourage further conversation. Emotional
detachment also encompasses emotional inexpressiveness, both verbally and non-verbally.
Individuals with prominent detachment do not talk about their feelings, and it is difficult to
discern what they might be feeling from their behaviours. In extreme cases, there is a lack of
emotional experience itself, and they are non-reactive to either negative or positive events, with a
limited capacity for enjoyment.","Disorder Name: Detachment in personality disorder or personality difficulty

The core feature of the disinhibition trait domain is the tendency to act rashly based on immediate
external or internal stimuli (i.e. sensations, emotions, thoughts), without consideration of
potential negative consequences. Common manifestations of disinhibition, not all of which may
be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following.
Impulsivity
Individuals with prominent disinhibition tend to act rashly based on whatever is compelling at
the moment, without consideration of negative consequences for themselves or others, including
putting themselves or others at physical risk. They have difficulty delaying reward or satisfaction,
and tend to pursue immediately available short-term pleasures or potential benefits. In this way,
the trait is strongly associated with such behaviours as substance use, gambling and impulsive
sexual activity.
Distractibility
Individuals with prominent disinhibition also have difficulty staying focused on important and
necessary tasks that require sustained effort. They quickly become bored or frustrated with
difficult, routine or tedious tasks, and are easily distracted by extraneous stimuli, such as others’
conversations. Even in the absence of distractions, they have difficulty keeping their attention
focused and persisting on tasks, and tend to scan the environment for more enjoyable options.
Irresponsibility
Individuals with prominent disinhibition are unreliable and lack a sense of accountability for
their actions. As a result, they often do not complete work assignments or perform expected
duties; they fail to meet deadlines, do not follow through on commitments and promises, and are
late to or miss formal and informal appointments and meetings because they allow themselves to
become engaged in something more compelling that has caught their attention.
Recklessness
Individuals with prominent disinhibition lack an appropriate sense of caution. They tend to
overestimate their abilities and thus frequently do things that are beyond their skill level, without
considering potential safety risks. Individuals with prominent disinhibition may engage in reckless
driving or dangerous sports, or perform other activities that put them or others in physical danger
without sufficient preparation or training.

Perfectionism
Perfectionism is manifested in concern with social rules, obligations, norms of right and wrong;

planning; and an emphasis on organization, orderliness and neatness. Individuals with prominent
anankastia have a very clear and detailed personal sense of perfection and imperfection that

what is perfect and right. They believe strongly that everyone should follow all rules exactly and
meet all obligations. Individuals with prominent anankastia may redo the work of others because
it does not meet their perfectionistic standards. They have difficulty in interpersonal relationships
because they hold others to the same standards as themselves, and are inflexible in their views.

Emotional and behavioural constraint is manifested in rigid control over emotional expression,
stubbornness and inflexibility, risk-avoidance, perseveration and deliberativeness. Individuals
with prominent anankastic traits tightly control their own emotional expression, and disapprove
of others’ displays of emotion. They are inflexible and lack spontaneity, stubbornly insisting on
following set schedules and adhering to plans. Their risk-avoidance includes both refusal to
engage in obviously risky activities and a more general overconcern about avoiding potential
negative consequences of any activity. They often perseverate and have difficulty disengaging
from tasks because they are perceived as not yet perfect down to the last detail. They are highly

Additional clinical features
• In delirium, cognition is typically impaired in a global manner, such that multiple areas of
neurocognitive functioning are impaired upon assessment.
• Delirium may include impaired perception, which can manifest as illusions (i.e.
misinterpretations of sensory inputs), delusions or hallucinations.
• Delirium often includes disturbance of emotion, including anxiety symptoms, depressed
mood, irritability, fear, anger, euphoria or apathy.
• Behavioural symptoms may be present (e.g. agitation, restlessness, impulsivity).

and complicate its course.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Delirium is
differentiated from age-related cognitive changes by the sudden onset of symptoms (e.g.
within hours or days), the presence of significant confusion and/or global neurocognitive
impairment, and the transient and typically fluctuating symptom presentation.
Course features
• Onset of symptoms is typically sudden (e.g. within hours or days), with a transient and/or
fluctuating course.
• Symptoms are generally expected to remit with treatment of the underlying etiology or
elimination of the causative substance from the body.

Additional clinical features
• In delirium, cognition is typically impaired in a global manner, such that multiple areas of
neurocognitive functioning are impaired upon assessment.
• Delirium may include impaired perception, which can manifest as illusions (i.e.
misinterpretations of sensory inputs), delusions or hallucinations.
• Delirium often includes disturbance of emotion, including anxiety symptoms, depressed
mood, irritability, fear, anger, euphoria or apathy.
• Behavioural symptoms may be present (e.g. agitation, restlessness, impulsivity).
A disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, including reduced arousal of acute onset or total
sleep loss followed by reversal of the sleep-wake cycle, may also be present.

It is relatively rare, representing less than 5% of all cases, and may be genetically determined (autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease). Clinical presentation may be similar to cases with later onset, but progression of cognitive deficits may be more rapid.
For this disease the diagnostical requirements are: Dementia due to Alzheimer disease with early onset
Essential (required) features
• All diagnostic requirements for dementia due to Alzheimer disease are met.
• Neurocognitive, functional and/or behavioural symptoms associated with Alzheimer
disease were present prior to the age of 65 years, as evidenced by neuropsychological
test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family history and/or
clinical history."

General cultural considerations for neurocognitive disorders
• Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic
factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of
daily living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for when
possible, as in the following examples.
• Test performance may be affected by cultural biases (e.g. references in test items to
terminology or objects not common to a culture) and limitations of translation and
adaptation.
• In evaluating functioning in important everyday skills, the expectations of the individual’s
culture and social environment should be considered.
• Similarly, when determining the presence of perceived or observed cognitive change,
it is important to consider cultural variations that may exist regarding expectations or
tolerance for cognitive change. For example, some degree of memory loss or cognitive
impairment might be seen as normal in some family or social systems, and may not be
fully recognized when existing support systems are available to compensate.

executive functioning, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor
speed, and visuoperceptual or visuospatial functioning.
• Evidence of neurocognitive impairment is based on:
• information obtained from the individual, an informant or clinical observation;
• substantial impairment in neurocognitive performance as demonstrated by standardized
neuropsychological/cognitive testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical
assessment.
• Behavioural changes (e.g. changes in personality, disinhibition, agitation, irritability) may
