5,6A00.Z,"Disorders of intellectual development, unspecified",,,,"Disorder of intellectual development, unspecifiedAdditional clinical features• No single physical feature or personality type is common to all individuals with disordersof intellectual development, although specific etiological groups may have commonphysical characteristics.• Disorders of intellectual development are associated with a high rate of co-occurringmental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, clinical presentationsmay vary depending on the individual’s age, level of severity of the disorder of intellectualdevelopment, communication skills and symptom complexity. Some disorders – suchas autism spectrum disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar and related disorders,schizophrenia, dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – occur morecommonly among individuals with disorders of intellectual development than in thegeneral population. Individuals with a co-occurring disorder of intellectual developmentand other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders are at similar risk ofsuicide as individuals with mental disorders who do not have a co-occurring disorder ofintellectual development.• Problem or challenging behaviours such as aggression, self-injurious behaviour, attention-seeking behaviour, oppositional defiant behaviour and sexually inappropriate behaviourare more frequent among those with disorders of intellectual development than in thegeneral population.• Many individuals with disorders of intellectual development are more gullible and naive,easier to deceive, and more prone to acquiescence and confabulation than people in thegeneral population. This can lead to various consequences, including greater likelihoodof victimization, becoming involved in criminal activities and providing inaccuratestatements to law enforcement.• Significant life changes and traumatic experiences can be particularly difficult for a personwith a disorder of intellectual development. Whereas the timing and type of life transitionsvary across societies, it is generally the case that individuals with disorders of intellectualNeurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 96 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersdevelopment need additional support adapting to changes in routine, structure, oreducational or living arrangements.• Many medical conditions can cause disorders of intellectual development and are, in turn,associated with specific additional medical problems. A variety of prenatal (e.g. exposureto toxic substances or harmful medications), perinatal (e.g. labour and delivery problems)and postnatal (e.g. infectious encephalopathies) factors may contribute to the developmentof disorders of intellectual development, and multiple etiologies may interact. Earlydiagnosis of the etiology of a disorder of intellectual development, when possible, canassist in the prevention and management of related medical problems (e.g. frequent thyroiddisease screening is recommended for individuals with Down syndrome). If the etiology ofa disorder of intellectual development in a particular individual has been established, thediagnosis corresponding to that etiology should also be assigned.• Individuals with disorders of intellectual development are at greater risk of a variety ofhealth (e.g. epilepsy) and social (e.g. poverty) problems across the lifespan.Boundary with normality (threshold)• In disorders of intellectual development, a measure of intelligence quotient (IQ) is notan isolated diagnostic requirement to distinguish disorder from normality, but should beconsidered a proxy measure of the significant limitations in intellectual functioning thatpartially characterize disorders of intellectual development. IQ scores may vary as a resultof the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and avariety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s developmentand life-course. The diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development should not bemade solely based on IQ scores but must also include a comprehensive evaluation ofadaptive behaviour.• Scores on individually administered standardized tests of intellectual and adaptivefunctioning may vary considerably over the course of an individual’s development, and itis quite possible that, during the developmental period, a child may meet the diagnosticrequirements of disorders of intellectual development on one occasion but not another.Multiple testing on different occasions during the developmental trajectory is necessary toestablish a reliable estimate of functioning.• Special care should be taken in differentiating disorders of intellectual developmentfrom normality when evaluating people with communication, sensory or motorimpairments; those exhibiting behavioural disturbances; immigrants; people with lowliteracy levels; people with mental disorders; people undergoing medical treatments(e.g. pharmacotherapy); and people who have experienced severe social or sensorydeprivation. If not adequately addressed during the evaluation, these factors may reducethe validity of scores obtained on standardized or behavioural measures of intellectual andadaptive functioning. For example, the reliable use of standardized measures of intellectualfunctioning and adaptive behaviour may pose particular challenges among individualswith motor coordination and communication impairments, and assessments must beselected that are appropriate to the individual’s capacities.• What is sometimes termed borderline intellectual functioning, defined as intellectualfunctioning between approximately 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean, is not adiagnosable disorder. Nonetheless, such individuals may present many needs for support andinterventions that are similar to those of people with disorders of intellectual development.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 97Course features• Disorders of intellectual development are lifespan conditions that typically manifest duringearly childhood and require consideration of developmental phases and life transitionswhereby periods of relatively greater need may alternate with those where less supportmay be necessary.• Disorders of intellectual development may show individual as well as etiology-specificvariation in developmental trajectories (i.e. periods of relative decline or amelioration infunctioning). Intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour can vary substantially acrossthe lifespan. Results from a single assessment, particularly those obtained during earlychildhood, may be of limited predictive use, as later functioning will be influenced by thelevel and type of interventions and support provided.• People with disorders of intellectual development typically need exceptional supportthroughout the lifespan, although the types and intensities of required support often changeover time depending on age, development, environmental factors and life circumstances.Most people with disorders of intellectual development continue to acquire skills andcompetencies over time. Providing interventions and support – including education –assists with this process and, if provided during the developmental period, may result inlower support needs in adulthood.Developmental presentations• There is wide variability in the developmental presentation and developmental trajectoriesof individuals with disorders of intellectual development. Tables 6.2–6.4 provide clinicianswith some of the key areas of strengths and weaknesses typically observed at different timepoints across development (i.e. early childhood, childhood, adolescence and adulthood) inindividuals with disorders of intellectual development.• Conditions related to disorders of intellectual development may be suspected during thefirst days and months of life due to the presence of certain physical signs such as facialdimorphisms, congenital malformation, micro- or macrocephalia, low weight, hypotonia,physical growth retardation, metabolic problems and failure to thrive, among others.• In older children, disorders of intellectual development may manifest as problems inacquiring academic knowledge and abilities such as reading, writing and arithmetic. Manychildren with mild disorder of intellectual development may not be referred for evaluationuntil they reach school age. Some individuals may remain undiagnosed until much later,during adolescence or adulthood.• The manifestations of disorders of intellectual development during late adolescence and thefirst years of adulthood may be strongly influenced by the presence of challenges related toassuming adult roles, such as postsecondary education, employment, independent livingand adult relationships.• Older adults with disorders of intellectual development may present with a more rapidonset of dementia or declining skills than older adults in the general population. Theyalso have significantly more difficulty gaining access to necessary support and appropriatehealth care for medical problems.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 98 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• The cultural appropriateness of tests and norms used to assess intellectual and adaptivefunctioning should be considered for each individual. Test performance may be affectedby cultural biases (e.g. reference in test items to terminology or objects not common to aculture) and limitations of translation.• In evaluating adaptive functioning (i.e. the individual’s conceptual, social and practicalskills), the expectations of the individual’s culture and social environment should beconsidered.• Language proficiency must also be considered when interpreting test results, in termsof both its impact on verbal performance and whether the individual understoodthe instructions.Sex- and/or gender-related features• The overall prevalence of disorders of intellectual development is slightly higher inmales. The prevalence of some etiologies of disorders of intellectual development differsbetween males and females (e.g. X-linked genetic conditions such as fragile X syndromeare predominantly diagnosed in males, whereas Turner syndrome occurs exclusively infemales).• A number of associated features of disorders of intellectual development differ betweenmales and females – for example, in the expression of problem behaviours and co-occurringmental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Males are more likely to exhibithyperactivity and conduct disturbances, whereas females are more likely to exhibit moodand anxiety symptoms.• Reduced social value and expectations placed on females compared to males in somesocieties may negatively affect the accurate identification and provision of support forfemales with disorders of intellectual development.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with developmental speech and language disordersIn developmental speech and language disorders, individuals exhibit difficulties in understanding orproducing speech and language, or in using language in context for the purposes of communicationthat is markedly below what would be expected given the individual’s age and level of intellectualfunctioning. If speech and language abilities are significantly below what would be expected basedon intellectual and adaptive behaviour functioning in an individual with a disorder of intellectualdevelopment, an additional diagnosis of developmental speech and language disorder maybe assigned.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 99Boundary with autism spectrum disorderAutism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in reciprocal social interaction andsocial communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, inflexible patterns of behaviour andinterests. Although many individuals with autism spectrum disorder present with the significantlimitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour observed in disorders of intellectualdevelopment, autism spectrum disorder can also present without general limitations in intellectualfunctioning. In cases of autism spectrum disorder where there are significant limitations inintellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour (i.e. 2 or more standard deviations below the meanor approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile) both the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorderusing the with disorder of intellectual development specifier and the diagnosis of a disorder ofintellectual development at the corresponding level of severity should be assigned. The diagnosisof autism spectrum disorder in individuals with severe and profound disorders of intellectualdevelopment is particularly difficult, and requires in-depth and longitudinal assessments. Becauseautism spectrum disorder inherently involves social deficits, assessment of adaptive behaviour asa part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development should place greateremphasis on the conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills.Boundary with developmental learning disordersDevelopmental learning disorders are characterized by significant and persistent difficulties inlearning academic skills including reading, writing and arithmetic, with performance in these areasmarkedly below what would be expected based on chronological age or intellectual level. Individualswith disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academic achievementby virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is therefore difficult toestablish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individuals with adisorder of intellectual development. However, developmental learning disorders can co-occurin some individuals with disorders of intellectual development if, despite adequate opportunities,acquisition of learning is significantly below what is expected based on established intellectualfunctioning. In such cases, both disorders may be diagnosed.Boundary with developmental motor coordination disordersIn developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals exhibit significant delays during thedevelopmental period in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills, and impairment in theexecution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy of motorperformance. Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may also display such motorcoordination difficulties that affect adaptive behaviour functioning. In contrast to those withdevelopmental motor coordination disorder, individuals with disorders of intellectual developmenthave accompanying significant limitations in intellectual functioning. However, if coordinatedmotor skills are significantly below what would be expected based on level of intellectual functioningand adaptive behaviour, and represent a separate focus of clinical attention, both diagnoses maybe assigned.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderIn attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, individuals show a persistent and generalized patternof inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that emerges during the developmental period.If all diagnostic requirements for a disorder of intellectual development are met, and inattentionand/or hyperactivity-impulsivity are found to be outside normal expected limits based on age andlevel of intellectual functioning, with significant interference in academic, occupational or socialfunctioning, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with dementiaIn dementia, affected individuals – usually older adults – exhibit a decline from a previous levelof functioning in multiple cognitive domains that interferes significantly with performance ofNeurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 100 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersactivities of daily living. The disorders can co-occur, and some adults with disorders of intellectualdevelopment are at greater and earlier risk of developing dementia. For example, individualswith Down syndrome who exhibit a marked decline in adaptive behaviour functioning should beevaluated for the emergence of dementia. In cases in which the diagnostic requirements for both adisorder of intellectual development and dementia are met and describe non-redundant aspects ofthe clinical presentation, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with other mental and behavioural disordersOther mental and behavioural disorders such as schizophrenia and other primary psychoticdisorders may include symptoms that interfere with intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour.A disorder of intellectual development should not be diagnosed if the limitations are better accountedfor by another mental and behavioural disorder. However, other mental and behavioural disordersare at least as prevalent in individuals with disorders of intellectual development as in the generalpopulation, and co-occurring diagnoses should be assigned if warranted. In evaluating mental andbehavioural disorders in individuals with disorders of intellectual development, signs and symptomsmust be assessed using methods that are appropriate to the individual’s level of development andintellectual functioning, and may require a greater reliance on observable signs and the reports ofothers who are familiar with the individual.Boundary with sensory impairmentsIf not addressed, sensory impairments (e.g. visual, auditory) can interfere with opportunities forlearning, resulting in apparent limitations in intellectual functioning or adaptive behaviour. If theobserved limitations are solely attributable to a sensory impairment, a disorder of intellectualdevelopment should not be assigned. However, prolonged sensory impairment throughout thecritical period of development may result in the persistence of limitations in intellectual functioningor adaptive behaviour, despite later intervention, and an additional diagnosis of a disorder ofintellectual development may be warranted in such cases.Boundary with effects of psychosocial deprivationExtreme psychosocial deprivation in early childhood can produce severe and selective impairmentsin specific mental functions such as language, social interaction and emotional expression.Depending on the onset, level of severity and duration of the deprivation, functioning in theseareas may improve substantially after the child is moved to a more positive environment. However,some deficits may persist even after a sustained period in an environment that provides adequatestimulation for development, and a diagnosis of a disorder of intellectual development may beappropriate in such cases if all diagnostic requirements are met.Boundary with neurodegenerative diseasesNeurodegenerative diseases can be associated with disorders of intellectual development but onlyif they have their onset in the developmental period (e.g. mucolipidosis type I, Gaucher’s diseasetype III). If a neurodegenerative disease co-occurs with a disorder of intellectual development, bothdiagnoses should be assigned.Boundary with secondary neurodevelopmental syndromeIf the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are met and the symptomsare attributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, bothdisorder of intellectual development and the underlying medical conditions should be diagnosed.If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are not met (e.g. limitationsin intellectual functioning without limitations in adaptive functioning) and the symptoms areattributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, a diagnosisof secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome should be assigned, together with the diagnosiscorresponding to the underlying medical condition.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 101Table 6.1.

Individuals with a co-occurring disorder of intellectual developmentand other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders are at similar risk ofsuicide as individuals with mental disorders who do not have a co-occurring disorder ofintellectual development.• Problem or challenging behaviours such as aggression, self-injurious behaviour, attention-seeking behaviour, oppositional defiant behaviour and sexually inappropriate behaviourare more frequent among those with disorders of intellectual development than in thegeneral population.• Many individuals with disorders of intellectual development are more gullible and naive,easier to deceive, and more prone to acquiescence and confabulation than people in thegeneral population. This can lead to various consequences, including greater likelihoodof victimization, becoming involved in criminal activities and providing inaccuratestatements to law enforcement.• Significant life changes and traumatic experiences can be particularly difficult for a personwith a disorder of intellectual development. Whereas the timing and type of life transitionsvary across societies, it is generally the case that individuals with disorders of intellectualNeurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 96 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersdevelopment need additional support adapting to changes in routine, structure, oreducational or living arrangements.• Many medical conditions can cause disorders of intellectual development and are, in turn,associated with specific additional medical problems. A variety of prenatal (e.g. exposureto toxic substances or harmful medications), perinatal (e.g. labour and delivery problems)and postnatal (e.g. infectious encephalopathies) factors may contribute to the developmentof disorders of intellectual development, and multiple etiologies may interact. Earlydiagnosis of the etiology of a disorder of intellectual development, when possible, canassist in the prevention and management of related medical problems (e.g. frequent thyroiddisease screening is recommended for individuals with Down syndrome). If the etiology ofa disorder of intellectual development in a particular individual has been established, thediagnosis corresponding to that etiology should also be assigned.• Individuals with disorders of intellectual development are at greater risk of a variety ofhealth (e.g. epilepsy) and social (e.g. poverty) problems across the lifespan.Boundary with normality (threshold)• In disorders of intellectual development, a measure of intelligence quotient (IQ) is notan isolated diagnostic requirement to distinguish disorder from normality, but should beconsidered a proxy measure of the significant limitations in intellectual functioning thatpartially characterize disorders of intellectual development. IQ scores may vary as a resultof the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and avariety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s developmentand life-course. The diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development should not bemade solely based on IQ scores but must also include a comprehensive evaluation ofadaptive behaviour.• Scores on individually administered standardized tests of intellectual and adaptivefunctioning may vary considerably over the course of an individual’s development, and itis quite possible that, during the developmental period, a child may meet the diagnosticrequirements of disorders of intellectual development on one occasion but not another.Multiple testing on different occasions during the developmental trajectory is necessary toestablish a reliable estimate of functioning.• Special care should be taken in differentiating disorders of intellectual developmentfrom normality when evaluating people with communication, sensory or motorimpairments; those exhibiting behavioural disturbances; immigrants; people with lowliteracy levels; people with mental disorders; people undergoing medical treatments(e.g. pharmacotherapy); and people who have experienced severe social or sensorydeprivation. If not adequately addressed during the evaluation, these factors may reducethe validity of scores obtained on standardized or behavioural measures of intellectual andadaptive functioning. For example, the reliable use of standardized measures of intellectualfunctioning and adaptive behaviour may pose particular challenges among individualswith motor coordination and communication impairments, and assessments must beselected that are appropriate to the individual’s capacities.• What is sometimes termed borderline intellectual functioning, defined as intellectualfunctioning between approximately 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean, is not adiagnosable disorder. Nonetheless, such individuals may present many needs for support andinterventions that are similar to those of people with disorders of intellectual development.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 97Course features• Disorders of intellectual development are lifespan conditions that typically manifest duringearly childhood and require consideration of developmental phases and life transitionswhereby periods of relatively greater need may alternate with those where less supportmay be necessary.• Disorders of intellectual development may show individual as well as etiology-specificvariation in developmental trajectories (i.e. periods of relative decline or amelioration infunctioning). Intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour can vary substantially acrossthe lifespan. Results from a single assessment, particularly those obtained during earlychildhood, may be of limited predictive use, as later functioning will be influenced by thelevel and type of interventions and support provided.• People with disorders of intellectual development typically need exceptional supportthroughout the lifespan, although the types and intensities of required support often changeover time depending on age, development, environmental factors and life circumstances.Most people with disorders of intellectual development continue to acquire skills andcompetencies over time. Providing interventions and support – including education –assists with this process and, if provided during the developmental period, may result inlower support needs in adulthood.Developmental presentations• There is wide variability in the developmental presentation and developmental trajectoriesof individuals with disorders of intellectual development. Tables 6.2–6.4 provide clinicianswith some of the key areas of strengths and weaknesses typically observed at different timepoints across development (i.e. early childhood, childhood, adolescence and adulthood) inindividuals with disorders of intellectual development.• Conditions related to disorders of intellectual development may be suspected during thefirst days and months of life due to the presence of certain physical signs such as facialdimorphisms, congenital malformation, micro- or macrocephalia, low weight, hypotonia,physical growth retardation, metabolic problems and failure to thrive, among others.• In older children, disorders of intellectual development may manifest as problems inacquiring academic knowledge and abilities such as reading, writing and arithmetic. Manychildren with mild disorder of intellectual development may not be referred for evaluationuntil they reach school age. Some individuals may remain undiagnosed until much later,during adolescence or adulthood.• The manifestations of disorders of intellectual development during late adolescence and thefirst years of adulthood may be strongly influenced by the presence of challenges related toassuming adult roles, such as postsecondary education, employment, independent livingand adult relationships.• Older adults with disorders of intellectual development may present with a more rapidonset of dementia or declining skills than older adults in the general population. Theyalso have significantly more difficulty gaining access to necessary support and appropriatehealth care for medical problems.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 98 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• The cultural appropriateness of tests and norms used to assess intellectual and adaptivefunctioning should be considered for each individual. Test performance may be affectedby cultural biases (e.g. reference in test items to terminology or objects not common to aculture) and limitations of translation.• In evaluating adaptive functioning (i.e. the individual’s conceptual, social and practicalskills), the expectations of the individual’s culture and social environment should beconsidered.• Language proficiency must also be considered when interpreting test results, in termsof both its impact on verbal performance and whether the individual understoodthe instructions.Sex- and/or gender-related features• The overall prevalence of disorders of intellectual development is slightly higher inmales. The prevalence of some etiologies of disorders of intellectual development differsbetween males and females (e.g. X-linked genetic conditions such as fragile X syndromeare predominantly diagnosed in males, whereas Turner syndrome occurs exclusively infemales).• A number of associated features of disorders of intellectual development differ betweenmales and females – for example, in the expression of problem behaviours and co-occurringmental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Males are more likely to exhibithyperactivity and conduct disturbances, whereas females are more likely to exhibit moodand anxiety symptoms.• Reduced social value and expectations placed on females compared to males in somesocieties may negatively affect the accurate identification and provision of support forfemales with disorders of intellectual development.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with developmental speech and language disordersIn developmental speech and language disorders, individuals exhibit difficulties in understanding orproducing speech and language, or in using language in context for the purposes of communicationthat is markedly below what would be expected given the individual’s age and level of intellectualfunctioning. If speech and language abilities are significantly below what would be expected basedon intellectual and adaptive behaviour functioning in an individual with a disorder of intellectualdevelopment, an additional diagnosis of developmental speech and language disorder maybe assigned.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 99Boundary with autism spectrum disorderAutism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in reciprocal social interaction andsocial communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, inflexible patterns of behaviour andinterests. Although many individuals with autism spectrum disorder present with the significantlimitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour observed in disorders of intellectualdevelopment, autism spectrum disorder can also present without general limitations in intellectualfunctioning. In cases of autism spectrum disorder where there are significant limitations inintellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour (i.e. 2 or more standard deviations below the meanor approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile) both the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorderusing the with disorder of intellectual development specifier and the diagnosis of a disorder ofintellectual development at the corresponding level of severity should be assigned. The diagnosisof autism spectrum disorder in individuals with severe and profound disorders of intellectualdevelopment is particularly difficult, and requires in-depth and longitudinal assessments. Becauseautism spectrum disorder inherently involves social deficits, assessment of adaptive behaviour asa part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development should place greateremphasis on the conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills.Boundary with developmental learning disordersDevelopmental learning disorders are characterized by significant and persistent difficulties inlearning academic skills including reading, writing and arithmetic, with performance in these areasmarkedly below what would be expected based on chronological age or intellectual level. Individualswith disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academic achievementby virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is therefore difficult toestablish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individuals with adisorder of intellectual development. However, developmental learning disorders can co-occurin some individuals with disorders of intellectual development if, despite adequate opportunities,acquisition of learning is significantly below what is expected based on established intellectualfunctioning. In such cases, both disorders may be diagnosed.Boundary with developmental motor coordination disordersIn developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals exhibit significant delays during thedevelopmental period in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills, and impairment in theexecution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy of motorperformance. Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may also display such motorcoordination difficulties that affect adaptive behaviour functioning. In contrast to those withdevelopmental motor coordination disorder, individuals with disorders of intellectual developmenthave accompanying significant limitations in intellectual functioning. However, if coordinatedmotor skills are significantly below what would be expected based on level of intellectual functioningand adaptive behaviour, and represent a separate focus of clinical attention, both diagnoses maybe assigned.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderIn attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, individuals show a persistent and generalized patternof inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that emerges during the developmental period.If all diagnostic requirements for a disorder of intellectual development are met, and inattentionand/or hyperactivity-impulsivity are found to be outside normal expected limits based on age andlevel of intellectual functioning, with significant interference in academic, occupational or socialfunctioning, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with dementiaIn dementia, affected individuals – usually older adults – exhibit a decline from a previous levelof functioning in multiple cognitive domains that interferes significantly with performance ofNeurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development 100 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersactivities of daily living. The disorders can co-occur, and some adults with disorders of intellectualdevelopment are at greater and earlier risk of developing dementia. For example, individualswith Down syndrome who exhibit a marked decline in adaptive behaviour functioning should beevaluated for the emergence of dementia. In cases in which the diagnostic requirements for both adisorder of intellectual development and dementia are met and describe non-redundant aspects ofthe clinical presentation, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with other mental and behavioural disordersOther mental and behavioural disorders such as schizophrenia and other primary psychoticdisorders may include symptoms that interfere with intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour.A disorder of intellectual development should not be diagnosed if the limitations are better accountedfor by another mental and behavioural disorder. However, other mental and behavioural disordersare at least as prevalent in individuals with disorders of intellectual development as in the generalpopulation, and co-occurring diagnoses should be assigned if warranted. In evaluating mental andbehavioural disorders in individuals with disorders of intellectual development, signs and symptomsmust be assessed using methods that are appropriate to the individual’s level of development andintellectual functioning, and may require a greater reliance on observable signs and the reports ofothers who are familiar with the individual.Boundary with sensory impairmentsIf not addressed, sensory impairments (e.g. visual, auditory) can interfere with opportunities forlearning, resulting in apparent limitations in intellectual functioning or adaptive behaviour. If theobserved limitations are solely attributable to a sensory impairment, a disorder of intellectualdevelopment should not be assigned. However, prolonged sensory impairment throughout thecritical period of development may result in the persistence of limitations in intellectual functioningor adaptive behaviour, despite later intervention, and an additional diagnosis of a disorder ofintellectual development may be warranted in such cases.Boundary with effects of psychosocial deprivationExtreme psychosocial deprivation in early childhood can produce severe and selective impairmentsin specific mental functions such as language, social interaction and emotional expression.Depending on the onset, level of severity and duration of the deprivation, functioning in theseareas may improve substantially after the child is moved to a more positive environment. However,some deficits may persist even after a sustained period in an environment that provides adequatestimulation for development, and a diagnosis of a disorder of intellectual development may beappropriate in such cases if all diagnostic requirements are met.Boundary with neurodegenerative diseasesNeurodegenerative diseases can be associated with disorders of intellectual development but onlyif they have their onset in the developmental period (e.g. mucolipidosis type I, Gaucher’s diseasetype III). If a neurodegenerative disease co-occurs with a disorder of intellectual development, bothdiagnoses should be assigned.Boundary with secondary neurodevelopmental syndromeIf the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are met and the symptomsare attributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, bothdisorder of intellectual development and the underlying medical conditions should be diagnosed.If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are not met (e.g. limitationsin intellectual functioning without limitations in adaptive functioning) and the symptoms areattributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, a diagnosisof secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome should be assigned, together with the diagnosiscorresponding to the underlying medical condition.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development Neurodevelopmental disorders 101Table 6.1.

behavioural indicators in the table are intended to be used by the clinician in determining the level of severity of the disorder of intellectual development, either as acomplement to properly normed, standardized tests, or when such tests are unavailable or inappropriate given the individual’s cultural and linguistic background. Use of theseindicators is predicated on the clinician’s knowledge of and experience with typically developing individuals of comparable age.

However, when the rate of speech increases, even familiar listenersmay not be able to understand the individual.• Developmental speech sound disorder may be associated with imprecision andinconsistency of oral movements required for speech, especially in young children(also called childhood apraxia or dyspraxia of speech), resulting in difficulty producingsequences of speech sounds, specific consonants and vowels, and appropriate prosody(intonation and rhythm of speech). There may be some associated oral-motor dysfunctionaffecting early feeding, sucking and chewing, blowing, and imitating oral movements andspeech sounds, but not with the weakness, slowness or incoordination found in dysarthria.• Developmental speech sound disorder commonly co-occurs with other neurodevelopmentaldisorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental speech fluencydisorder and developmental language disorder.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Children vary widely in the sequence and age at which they acquire speech sounds. Suchnormal variation does not reflect the presence of developmental speech sound disorder. Incontrast, children with developmental speech sound disorder exhibit persistent problemsthat cause significant limitations in the ability to communicate due to reduced intelligibilityof speech. Up until the age of 4 years, various speech sound errors are common amongchildren with typically developing speech sound acquisition, but communication remainsrelatively intact despite these errors, relative to same-aged peers.Course features• Many young children with developmental speech sound disorder experience remission byschool age. Among young children diagnosed in early childhood, up to 50–70% will exhibitacademic difficulties throughout their schooling, even if the speech sound difficultiesthemselves have remitted.• Compared to children and adolescents with a sole diagnosis of developmental speechsound disorder, those with a co-occurring developmental language disorder are morelikely to develop other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders such asanxiety and fear-related disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

In particular, these children are more likely to develop languageimpairments and reading difficulties, and tend to experience worse outcomes.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Developmental speech sound disorder is more prevalent among boys, especially at youngerages. Early speech difficulties in girls appear more likely to resolve by school age.

Rather, a diagnosis ofsecondary speech or language syndrome should be assigned in addition to the associated medicalcondition if the speech sound difficulties are a specific focus of clinical attention.Boundary with secondary speech or language syndromeThe diagnosis of developmental speech sound disorder should not be assigned in the presenceof a disease of the nervous system affecting the brain, peripheral nerves or neuromusculature(e.g. cerebral palsy, myasthenia gravis); sensory impairment (e.g. sensory neural deafness); orstructural impairment (e.g. cleft palate), although speech sound production difficulties may be apresenting feature of any of these conditions. In these cases, a diagnosis of secondary speech orlanguage syndrome should be assigned in addition to the associated medical condition if the speechsound difficulties are a specific focus of clinical attention."

21,6A03.Z,"Developmental learning disorder, unspecified",,,,"Developmental learning disorder, unspecifiedNeurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder 136 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• Individuals with developmental learning disorder typically show impairments invarious underlying psychological processes that may include phonological processing,orthographic processing, memory (including working memory), executive functions(including inhibitory control, set-shifting, planning), learning and automatizing symbols(e.g. visual, alphanumeric), perceptual-motor integration and speed of processinginformation. Deficits in these psychological processes are presumed to underlie a child’sability to learn academic skills. However, the precise relationship between psychologicalprocesses and outcomes related to learning capacity is not yet sufficiently understood toallow an accurate and clinically useful classification based on these underlying processes.• Developmental learning disorder commonly co-occurs with other neurodevelopmentaldisorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental motorcoordination disorder, developmental language disorder and autism spectrum disorder.• Many individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties self-regulating attention that are not sufficiently severe to warrant a separate diagnosis.Persistent difficulties with self-regulated attention can have deleterious effects on academicoutcomes, and may impede response to intervention or support.• Some individuals with developmental learning disorder may be able to sustain seeminglyadequate levels of key academic skills by using compensatory strategies or throughdevoting extraordinarily high levels of effort or time, or through the provision of unusuallyhigh levels of support. However, as demands for efficiency in key academic skills increaseand exceed capabilities (e.g. in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy detailed reportsfor a tight deadline, heavier academic coursework as in high school/secondary school,postsecondary education or professional training), the underlying learning difficultiestend to become more fully apparent.• Ideally, determination of the presence of developmental learning disorder includesassessment of academic achievement using standardized, appropriately normedinstruments. However, a child’s score on a single test measuring a particular academic skillis not sufficient to distinguish disorder from normality. Achievement scores may vary as aresult of the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and avariety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s developmentand life-course. Therefore, the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder should alsoconsider various sources of evidence regarding the child’s capacity for learning outside theformal testing situation.Boundary with normality (threshold)• The age of acquisition of academic skills varies, and later acquisition of a particular academicskill compared to same-age peers does not necessarily indicate the presence of a disorder.Developmental learning disorder is distinguished by persistent difficulty in learning theparticular academic skills over time in spite of adequate educational opportunities, and bythe severity of the impairment caused by the learning difficulty.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 137Course features• Deficits in reading, mathematics and written expression identified in childhood typicallypersist through adolescence and into adulthood. These deficits may negatively affect achild’s academic achievement, increase the likelihood of school dropout, and contribute tounemployment (or underemployment) in adulthood – particularly if left untreated. Alongwith school dropout, significant co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk ofpoor mental health outcomes, including suicide.• The specific impairments associated with developmental learning disorder vary withdevelopmental stage and learning abilities, severity of deficits, complexity of tasks,presence of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, and theavailability of support.• Developmental learning disorder is also associated with heightened risk of suicidal ideationand suicide attempts across the lifespan.Developmental presentations• Developmental learning disorder is most often diagnosed during elementary school yearsbecause difficulties in reading, mathematics and/or writing typically only become evidentwhen these topics are taught formally. Some individuals, however, may not be diagnoseduntil later in development, including in adulthood. Premorbid impairments, such as inlanguage, counting or rhyming, or fine motor control tend to be evident in early childhoodprior to the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder.• The prevalence of developmental learning disorder across all areas of impairment(i.e. reading, written expression and mathematics) is estimated to affect between 5% and15% of school-aged children. Prevalence among adults is unknown, but is estimated atapproximately 4%. The prevalence of developmental learning disorder for specific academicareas among school-aged children is variable (reading is estimated at 5–17%; mathematicsat 6–7%; written expression at 7–15%).• Children with developmental learning disorder frequently exhibit co-occurring symptomsof depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and externalizing behaviourdisorders, which may make it more difficult to assess their learning impairments.• Children with developmental learning disorder with impairment in one academic area aremore likely to have co-occurring impairments in other areas.Culture-related features• Developmental learning disorder with impairment in reading can be manifested differentlyby language. For example, in English, the presentation involves inaccurate and slow readingof single words. In other languages with more direct mapping between sounds and letters(e.g. Spanish, German) and non-alphabetic languages (e.g. Chinese, Japanese), the typicalpresentation is slow but accurate reading.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder 138 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersSex- and/or gender-related features• Developmental learning disorder is more common among boys. Boys may be more likelyto be clinically referred because of greater prevalence of co-occurring attention deficithyperactivity disorder or problematic externalizing behaviours.• Among community samples, the gender ratio of males to females ranges from 1.5:1 to 3:1.This ratio appears greater in clinical samples (estimated at 6:1).Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with disorders of intellectual developmentIndividuals with disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academicachievement by virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is thereforedifficult to establish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individualswith a disorder of intellectual development. Developmental learning disorder should onlybe diagnosed in the presence of a disorder of intellectual development when the limitations inlearning are significantly in excess of those usually expected for the individual’s level of intellectualfunctioning.Boundary with developmental language disorderPersistent deficits in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language in developmentallanguage disorder may lead to academic learning difficulties, especially in literacy – including wordreading and written output. If all diagnostic requirements for both developmental language disorderand developmental learning disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderMany individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties in self-regulatingattention. However, unlike in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the limitations in acquisitionof academic skills in developmental learning disorder are not solely a function of a child’s ability tosustain attention on academic tasks or modulate their activity level appropriately. The co-occurrenceof developmental learning disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is common, andboth disorders may be diagnosed if diagnostic requirements are met.Boundary with sensory impairmentsDevelopmental learning disorder must be differentiated from learning difficulties that arise becauseof sensory impairments in vision or hearing. However, individuals with vision and hearing problemsfor which appropriate accommodations have been made may also have co-occurring developmentallearning disorder.Boundary with neurodegenerative diseasesDevelopmental learning disorder is distinguished from learning difficulties that occur after thedevelopmental period due to neurodegenerative diseases or to injury (e.g. traumatic brain injury)by the fact that in the latter conditions there is a loss of previously acquired academic skills andprevious capacity for learning new skills.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 139","Developmental learning disorder, unspecified","Developmental learning disorder, unspecifiedNeurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder 136 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• Individuals with developmental learning disorder typically show impairments invarious underlying psychological processes that may include phonological processing,orthographic processing, memory (including working memory), executive functions(including inhibitory control, set-shifting, planning), learning and automatizing symbols(e.g. visual, alphanumeric), perceptual-motor integration and speed of processinginformation. Deficits in these psychological processes are presumed to underlie a child’sability to learn academic skills. However, the precise relationship between psychologicalprocesses and outcomes related to learning capacity is not yet sufficiently understood toallow an accurate and clinically useful classification based on these underlying processes.• Developmental learning disorder commonly co-occurs with other neurodevelopmentaldisorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental motorcoordination disorder, developmental language disorder and autism spectrum disorder.• Many individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties self-regulating attention that are not sufficiently severe to warrant a separate diagnosis.Persistent difficulties with self-regulated attention can have deleterious effects on academicoutcomes, and may impede response to intervention or support.• Some individuals with developmental learning disorder may be able to sustain seeminglyadequate levels of key academic skills by using compensatory strategies or throughdevoting extraordinarily high levels of effort or time, or through the provision of unusuallyhigh levels of support. However, as demands for efficiency in key academic skills increaseand exceed capabilities (e.g. in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy detailed reportsfor a tight deadline, heavier academic coursework as in high school/secondary school,postsecondary education or professional training), the underlying learning difficultiestend to become more fully apparent.• Ideally, determination of the presence of developmental learning disorder includesassessment of academic achievement using standardized, appropriately normedinstruments. However, a child’s score on a single test measuring a particular academic skillis not sufficient to distinguish disorder from normality. Achievement scores may vary as aresult of the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and avariety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s developmentand life-course. Therefore, the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder should alsoconsider various sources of evidence regarding the child’s capacity for learning outside theformal testing situation.Boundary with normality (threshold)• The age of acquisition of academic skills varies, and later acquisition of a particular academicskill compared to same-age peers does not necessarily indicate the presence of a disorder.Developmental learning disorder is distinguished by persistent difficulty in learning theparticular academic skills over time in spite of adequate educational opportunities, and bythe severity of the impairment caused by the learning difficulty.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 137Course features• Deficits in reading, mathematics and written expression identified in childhood typicallypersist through adolescence and into adulthood. These deficits may negatively affect achild’s academic achievement, increase the likelihood of school dropout, and contribute tounemployment (or underemployment) in adulthood – particularly if left untreated. Alongwith school dropout, significant co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk ofpoor mental health outcomes, including suicide.• The specific impairments associated with developmental learning disorder vary withdevelopmental stage and learning abilities, severity of deficits, complexity of tasks,presence of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, and theavailability of support.• Developmental learning disorder is also associated with heightened risk of suicidal ideationand suicide attempts across the lifespan.Developmental presentations• Developmental learning disorder is most often diagnosed during elementary school yearsbecause difficulties in reading, mathematics and/or writing typically only become evidentwhen these topics are taught formally. Some individuals, however, may not be diagnoseduntil later in development, including in adulthood. Premorbid impairments, such as inlanguage, counting or rhyming, or fine motor control tend to be evident in early childhoodprior to the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder.• The prevalence of developmental learning disorder across all areas of impairment(i.e. reading, written expression and mathematics) is estimated to affect between 5% and15% of school-aged children. Prevalence among adults is unknown, but is estimated atapproximately 4%. The prevalence of developmental learning disorder for specific academicareas among school-aged children is variable (reading is estimated at 5–17%; mathematicsat 6–7%; written expression at 7–15%).• Children with developmental learning disorder frequently exhibit co-occurring symptomsof depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and externalizing behaviourdisorders, which may make it more difficult to assess their learning impairments.• Children with developmental learning disorder with impairment in one academic area aremore likely to have co-occurring impairments in other areas.Culture-related features• Developmental learning disorder with impairment in reading can be manifested differentlyby language. For example, in English, the presentation involves inaccurate and slow readingof single words. In other languages with more direct mapping between sounds and letters(e.g. Spanish, German) and non-alphabetic languages (e.g. Chinese, Japanese), the typicalpresentation is slow but accurate reading.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder 138 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersSex- and/or gender-related features• Developmental learning disorder is more common among boys. Boys may be more likelyto be clinically referred because of greater prevalence of co-occurring attention deficithyperactivity disorder or problematic externalizing behaviours.• Among community samples, the gender ratio of males to females ranges from 1.5:1 to 3:1.This ratio appears greater in clinical samples (estimated at 6:1).Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with disorders of intellectual developmentIndividuals with disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academicachievement by virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is thereforedifficult to establish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individualswith a disorder of intellectual development. Developmental learning disorder should onlybe diagnosed in the presence of a disorder of intellectual development when the limitations inlearning are significantly in excess of those usually expected for the individual’s level of intellectualfunctioning.Boundary with developmental language disorderPersistent deficits in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language in developmentallanguage disorder may lead to academic learning difficulties, especially in literacy – including wordreading and written output. If all diagnostic requirements for both developmental language disorderand developmental learning disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderMany individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties in self-regulatingattention.

Coordinated motor skills are markedly below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g. in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities).

Attentional problems may be more commonly observedbeginning in later childhood, especially in school and among adults in occupational settings.• The manifestations and severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often varyaccording to the characteristics and demands of the environment. Symptoms and behavioursshould be evaluated across multiple types of environments as a part of clinical assessment.• Where available, teacher and parent reports should be obtained to establish the diagnosisin children and adolescents. In adults, the report of a significant other, family member orco-worker can provide important additional information.• Some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may first present for servicesin adulthood. When making the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder inadults, a history of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity before 12 years of age is animportant corroborating feature that can be best established from school or local records,or from informants who knew the individual during childhood. In the absence of suchcorroborating information, a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in olderadolescents and adults should be made with caution.• In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially inchildren, an exclusively inattentive presentation may occur. There is no hyperactivity, andthe presentation is characterized by daydreaming, mind-wandering and a lack of focus.These children are sometimes referred to as exhibiting a restrictive inattentive pattern ofsymptoms or sluggish cognitive tempo.• In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combinedpresentation, severe inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity are both consistentlypresent in most of the situations that an individual encounters, and are also evidenced bythe clinician’s own observations. This pattern is often referred to as hyperkinetic disorder,and is considered a more severe form of the disorder.• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms often significantly limit academicachievement. Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often find it difficult tohold down a demanding job, and may be disproportionately underemployed or unemployed.Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can also strain interpersonal relationships acrossthe lifespan, including those with family members, peers and romantic partners. Individualswith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have greater difficulty regulating theirbehaviour in the context of groups than in one-on-one situations.• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmentaldisorders, including developmental speech and language disorders and primary tics andtic disorders, which are classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system butcross-listed under neurodevelopment disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder isassociated with an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and gaming disorder,and with elevated rates of epilepsy. Emotional dysregulation, low frustration toleranceand subtle clumsiness and other minor (soft) neurological abnormalities in sensory andmotor performance in the absence of any identifiable brain pathology are also common inattention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 146 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of physicalhealth problems including accidents.• Acute onset of hyperactive behaviour in a school-aged child or adolescent should raisethe possibility that symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder or by amedical condition. For example, abrupt onset of hyperactivity in adolescence or adulthoodmay indicate an emergent primary psychotic or bipolar disorder.• Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder tends to run in families, with evidenceof high heritability, the predominant symptom pattern in attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder in a given individual often changes over time and cannot be predicted based onthe predominant symptoms of other family members.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms are present in many children,adolescents and adults, especially during certain developmental periods (e.g. earlychildhood). The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder requires that thesesymptoms be persistent across time, pervasive across situations and significantly outof keeping with developmental level, and have a direct negative impact on academic,occupational or social functioning.Course features• Nearly half of all children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder willcontinue to exhibit symptoms into adolescence. Predictors of persistence into adolescenceand adulthood include co-occurring childhood-onset mental, behavioural andneurodevelopmental disorders, lower intellectual functioning, poorer social functioningand behavioural problems.• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend to remain stable throughoutadolescence, with approximately one third of individuals diagnosed in childhoodcontinuing to experience impairment in adulthood.• Although symptoms of hyperactivity become less overt during adolescence and adulthood,individuals may still experience difficulties with inattention, impulsivity and restlessness.Developmental presentations• Adolescents and adults may only seek clinical services after 12 years of age, once symptomsbecome more limiting with increasing social, emotional and academic demands or in thecontext of an evolving co-occurring mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorderthat results in an exacerbation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 147Culture-related features• The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder consistently fall into two separatedimensions across cultures: inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. However, culturecan influence both acceptability of symptoms and how caregivers respond to them.• The assessment of hyperactivity should take into account cultural norms of age and gender-appropriate behaviour. For example, in some countries hyperactive behaviour may be seenas a sign of strength in a boy (e.g. boiling blood) while being perceived very negativelyin a girl.• Symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity may occur in response to exposureto traumatic events and grief reactions during childhood, particularly in highly vulnerableand disadvantaged populations, including in post-conflict areas. In these settings,clinicians should consider whether the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorderis warranted.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent among males.• Females are more likely to exhibit inattentive symptoms whereas males are more likely toexhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, particularly at younger ages.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with disorders of intellectual developmentCo-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disorders of intellectual developmentis common, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted. However, symptoms of inattentionand hyperactivity (e.g. restlessness) are common in children without attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder who are placed in academic settings that are out of keeping with their intellectual abilities.A diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in individuals with disorders of intellectualdevelopment requires that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms are disproportionateto the individual’s level of intellectual functioning.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderSpecific abnormalities in attention (e.g. being overly focused or easily distracted), impulsivity andphysical hyperactivity are often observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and maysometimes dominate the clinical presentation. Unlike individuals with autism spectrum disorder,those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit the persistent deficits in initiatingand sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions, or the persistent restricted,repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are the defining features ofautism spectrum disorder. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 148 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with developmental learning disorderIndividuals with developmental learning disorder without attention deficit hyperactivity disordermay exhibit symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity when asked to focus on specific academicactivities that correspond to their areas of difficulty (i.e. reading, mathematics or writing). If difficultyin sustaining attention on academic tasks or appropriately modulating activity level occurs onlyin response to these tasks, and there is evidence of limitations in acquisition of academic skills inthe specific corresponding area, a diagnosis of developmental learning disorder and not attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder should be assigned.Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorderCo-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental motor coordinationdisorder is common, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted. However, apparentclumsiness in some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (e.g. bumping intoobstacles, knocking things over) that is due to distractibility and impulsivity should not be diagnosedas developmental motor coordination disorder.Boundary with mood disorders and anxiety and fear-related disordersAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur with mood disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders, but inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity can also be features of these disordersin individuals without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. For example, symptoms such asrestlessness, pacing and impaired concentration can be features of a depressive episode, and shouldnot be considered as part of the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder unless they havebeen present since childhood and persist after the resolution of the depressive episode. Inattention,impulsivity and hyperactivity are typical features of manic and hypomanic episodes. At the sametime, mood lability and irritability may be associated features of attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. Late adolescent or adult onset, episodicity and intensity of mood elevation characteristicof bipolar disorders are features that assist in differentiation from attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. Fidgeting, restlessness and tension in the context of anxiety and fear-related disorders mayresemble hyperactivity. Furthermore, anxious preoccupations or reaction to anxiety-provokingstimuli in individuals with anxiety and fear-related disorders can be associated with difficultiesconcentrating. To qualify for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis in the presenceof a mood disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder, inattention and/or hyperactivity shouldnot be exclusively associated with mood episodes, be solely attributable to anxious preoccupations,or occur specifically in response to anxiety-provoking situations.Boundary with intermittent explosive disorderAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder and intermittent explosive disorder are both characterizedby impulsive behaviour. However, intermittent explosive disorder is specifically characterized byintermittent severe impulsive outbursts or aggression rather than ongoing generalized behaviouralimpulsivity that may be seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIndividuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have difficulty following instructions,complying with rules and getting along with others, but these difficulties are primarily accountedfor by symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity (e.g. failure to follow long andcomplicated instructions, difficulty remaining seated or staying on task). In contrast, noncompliancein individuals with oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by deliberate defiance ordisobedience and not by problems with inattention or with controlling behavioural impulses orinhibiting inappropriate behaviours. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common.Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorderIn adolescents and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, some behaviours that aremanifestations of impulsivity such as grabbing objects, reckless driving or impulsive decision-making– such as suddenly walking out of jobs or relationships – may bring the individual in conflict withNeurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 149other people and the law. In contrast, individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder typically lackthe symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, and exhibit a repetitive and persistent pattern ofbehaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules or lawsare violated. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common.Boundary with personality disorderIndividuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often experience problems with psychosocialfunctioning and interpersonal relationships, including regulation of emotions and negativeemotionality. If attention deficit hyperactivity disorder persists into adolescence and adulthood,it may be difficult to distinguish from personality disorder with prominent personality features ofdisinhibition, which includes irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility and recklessness, and fromnegative affectivity, which refers to a habitual tendency to manifest a broad range of distressingemotions including anxiety, anger, self-loathing, irritability and increased sensitivity to negativestimuli. The utility of assigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in situations wherethere is an established diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder depends on the specificclinical situation.Boundary with disorders due to substance use and the effects of certain prescribedmedicationsAbuse of alcohol, nicotine, cannabis and stimulants is common among individuals with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly adolescents and adults. However, the effects of thesesubstances can also mimic the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in individualswithout the diagnosis. Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity are also associatedwith the effects of certain prescribed medications (e.g. anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine andvalproate, antipsychotics such as risperidone, and somatic treatments such as bronchodilators andthyroid replacement medication). The temporal order of onset and the persistence of inattention,hyperactivity and impulsivity in the absence of intoxication or continued medication use areimportant in differentiating between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disorders dueto substance use or the effects of prescribed medications. A review of current medications andinformants who knew the individual before they started using the substances or medications inquestion are critical in making this distinction.Boundary with attentional symptoms due to other medical conditionsA variety of other medical conditions may influence attentional processes (e.g. hypoglycaemia,hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, exposure to toxins, sleep-wake disorders), resulting intemporary or persistent symptoms that resemble or interact with those of attention deficithyperactivity disorder. As a basis for appropriate management, it is important to evaluate in suchcases whether the symptoms are secondary to the medical condition or are more indicative ofcomorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, presentation unspecified","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, presentation unspecifiedNeurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 145Additional clinical features• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder usually manifests in early or middle childhood.In many cases, hyperactivity symptoms predominate in preschool and decrease with age,such that they are no longer prominent beyond adolescence or may instead be reported asfeelings of physical restlessness. Attentional problems may be more commonly observedbeginning in later childhood, especially in school and among adults in occupational settings.• The manifestations and severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often varyaccording to the characteristics and demands of the environment. Symptoms and behavioursshould be evaluated across multiple types of environments as a part of clinical assessment.• Where available, teacher and parent reports should be obtained to establish the diagnosisin children and adolescents. In adults, the report of a significant other, family member orco-worker can provide important additional information.• Some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may first present for servicesin adulthood. When making the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder inadults, a history of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity before 12 years of age is animportant corroborating feature that can be best established from school or local records,or from informants who knew the individual during childhood. In the absence of suchcorroborating information, a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in olderadolescents and adults should be made with caution.• In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially inchildren, an exclusively inattentive presentation may occur. There is no hyperactivity, andthe presentation is characterized by daydreaming, mind-wandering and a lack of focus.These children are sometimes referred to as exhibiting a restrictive inattentive pattern ofsymptoms or sluggish cognitive tempo.• In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combinedpresentation, severe inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity are both consistentlypresent in most of the situations that an individual encounters, and are also evidenced bythe clinician’s own observations. This pattern is often referred to as hyperkinetic disorder,and is considered a more severe form of the disorder.• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms often significantly limit academicachievement. Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often find it difficult tohold down a demanding job, and may be disproportionately underemployed or unemployed.Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can also strain interpersonal relationships acrossthe lifespan, including those with family members, peers and romantic partners. Individualswith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have greater difficulty regulating theirbehaviour in the context of groups than in one-on-one situations.• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmentaldisorders, including developmental speech and language disorders and primary tics andtic disorders, which are classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system butcross-listed under neurodevelopment disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder isassociated with an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and gaming disorder,and with elevated rates of epilepsy. Emotional dysregulation, low frustration toleranceand subtle clumsiness and other minor (soft) neurological abnormalities in sensory andmotor performance in the absence of any identifiable brain pathology are also common inattention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 146 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of physicalhealth problems including accidents.• Acute onset of hyperactive behaviour in a school-aged child or adolescent should raisethe possibility that symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder or by amedical condition. For example, abrupt onset of hyperactivity in adolescence or adulthoodmay indicate an emergent primary psychotic or bipolar disorder.• Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder tends to run in families, with evidenceof high heritability, the predominant symptom pattern in attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder in a given individual often changes over time and cannot be predicted based onthe predominant symptoms of other family members.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms are present in many children,adolescents and adults, especially during certain developmental periods (e.g. earlychildhood). The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder requires that thesesymptoms be persistent across time, pervasive across situations and significantly outof keeping with developmental level, and have a direct negative impact on academic,occupational or social functioning.Course features• Nearly half of all children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder willcontinue to exhibit symptoms into adolescence. Predictors of persistence into adolescenceand adulthood include co-occurring childhood-onset mental, behavioural andneurodevelopmental disorders, lower intellectual functioning, poorer social functioningand behavioural problems.• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend to remain stable throughoutadolescence, with approximately one third of individuals diagnosed in childhoodcontinuing to experience impairment in adulthood.• Although symptoms of hyperactivity become less overt during adolescence and adulthood,individuals may still experience difficulties with inattention, impulsivity and restlessness.Developmental presentations• Adolescents and adults may only seek clinical services after 12 years of age, once symptomsbecome more limiting with increasing social, emotional and academic demands or in thecontext of an evolving co-occurring mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorderthat results in an exacerbation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders 147Culture-related features• The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder consistently fall into two separatedimensions across cultures: inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.

In schizophrenia,multiple persistent symptoms are present, and are typically accompanied by impairment incognitive functioning and other psychosocial problems.Course features• The course and onset of schizophrenia is variable. Some experience exacerbations andremission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others experience a gradualworsening of symptoms, and a smaller proportion experience complete remission ofsymptoms.• Positive symptoms tend to diminish naturally over time, whereas negative symptoms oftenpersist and are closely tied to a poorer prognosis. Cognitive symptoms also tend to be morepersistent, and when present are associated with ongoing functional impairment.• Early-onset schizophrenia is typically associated with a poorer prognosis whereas affectiveand social functioning are more likely to be preserved with later onset.Developmental presentations• Onset of fully symptomatic schizophrenia before puberty is extremely rare; when it occursit is often preceded by a decline in social and academic functioning, odd behaviour,and a change in affect observable during the prodromal phase. Childhood onset is alsoassociated with a greater prevalence of delays in social, language or motor developmentand co-occurring disorder of intellectual development or developmental learning disorder.• In children and young adolescents, auditory hallucinations most commonly occuras a single voice commenting on or commanding behaviour whereas in adults suchhallucinations are more typically experienced as multiple conversing voices.• In children and adolescents, it may be challenging to differentiate delusions andhallucinations from more developmentally typical phenomena (e.g. a monster underthe child’s bed, an imaginary friend), actual plausible life experiences (e.g. being teasedor bullied at school), and irrational or magical thinking common in childhood (e.g. thatthinking about something will make it happen).• Among children with schizophrenia, negative symptoms, hallucinations and disorganizedthinking – including loose associations, illogical thinking and paucity of speech – tend tobe prominent features of the clinical presentation. Disorganized thinking and behaviouroccur in a variety of disorders that are common in childhood (e.g. autism spectrumdisorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), which should be considered beforeattributing the symptoms to the much less common childhood schizophrenia.Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia 168 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• Cultural factors may influence the onset, symptom pattern, course and outcomeof schizophrenia. For example, among migrants and ethnic and cultural minoritycommunities, living in areas with a low proportion of their own migrant, ethnic or culturalgroup (low ethnic density) is associated with higher rates of schizophrenia. In addition,etiological or course-related factors may be affected by culture at the level of the family(e.g. level of family support or style of family interaction, such as expressed emotion) or atthe societal context (e.g. industrialization, urbanization). For example, the prevalence ofschizophrenia is much higher in urban than rural settings.• The risk of misdiagnosing the expression of distress as indicative of schizophreniaor another primary psychotic disorder may be increased among ethnic minority andimmigrant groups, and in other situations in which the clinician is unfamiliar withculturally normative expressions of distress. These include situations involving spiritualor supernatural beliefs or resulting from migration trauma, social isolation, minority andacculturative stress, discrimination and victimization.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Schizophrenia is more prevalent among males.• The age of onset of the first psychotic episode differs by gender, with a greater proportionof males experiencing onset in their early to mid-20s and females in their late 20s.• Females with schizophrenia tend to report more positive symptoms that increase in severityover the course of their lives. Females also tend to have greater mood disturbance and agreater prevalence of subsequent or co-occurring mental disorders (e.g. schizoaffectivedisorder, depressive disorders).• Females with schizophrenia are less likely to exhibit disorganized thinking, negativesymptoms and social impairment.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with schizoaffective disorderThe diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are intended to apply to the currentor most recent episode of the disorder. In other words, a previous diagnosis of schizoaffectivedisorder does not preclude a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and vice versa. In both schizophrenia andschizoaffective disorder, at least two the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia are present most ofthe time for a period of 1 month or more. In schizoaffective disorder, the symptoms of schizophreniaare present concurrently with mood symptoms that meet the full diagnostic requirements of amood episode and last for at least 1 month, and the onsets of the psychotic and mood symptomsare either simultaneous or occur within a few days of one another. In schizophrenia, co-occurringmood symptoms, if any, either do not persist for as long as 1 month or are not of sufficient severitySchizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders 169to meet the requirements of a moderate or severe depressive episode, a manic episode or a mixedepisode. (See mood episode descriptions, p. 212.) An episode that initially meets the diagnosticrequirements for schizoaffective disorder in which only the mood symptoms remit, so that theduration of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms is much longer than the duration ofconcurrent symptoms, may be best characterized as an episode of schizophrenia.Boundary with acute and transient psychotic disorderThe psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia persist for at least 1 month in their full, florid form.In contrast, the symptoms in acute and transient psychotic disorder tend to fluctuate rapidly inintensity and type across time, such that the content and focus of delusions or hallucinations oftenshift, even on a daily basis. Such rapid shifts would be unusual in schizophrenia. Negative symptomsare often present in schizophrenia, but do not occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder. Theduration of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, and most often lastsfrom a few days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for schizophrenia. In casesthat meet the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia except that they have lasted less than theduration required for a diagnosis (i.e. 1 month) in the absence of a previous history of schizophrenia,a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder and not acute and transient psychoticdisorder should be assigned.Boundary with schizotypal disorderSchizotypal disorder is characterized by an enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions,beliefs and behaviours that resemble attenuated forms of the defining symptoms of schizophrenia.Schizophrenia is differentiated from schizotypal disorder based entirely on the intensity ofthe symptoms: schizophrenia is diagnosed if the symptoms are sufficiently intense to meetdiagnostic requirements.Boundary with delusional disorderBoth schizophrenia and delusional disorder may be characterized by persistent delusions. Ifother features are present that meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia (i.e. persistenthallucinations; disorganized thinking; experiences of influence, passivity or control; negativesymptoms; disorganized or abnormal psychomotor behaviour), a diagnosis of schizophreniashould be made instead of a diagnosis of delusional disorder. However, hallucinations that areconsistent with the content of the delusions and do not occur persistently (i.e. with regularfrequency for 1 month or longer) are consistent with a diagnosis of delusional disorder rather thanschizophrenia. Delusional disorder is generally characterized by relatively preserved personalityand less deterioration and impairment in social and occupational functioning than schizophrenia,and individuals with delusional disorder tend to come to clinical attention for the first time at a laterage. Individuals with symptom presentations consistent with delusional disorder (e.g. delusions andrelated, circumscribed hallucinations) but who have not met the minimum duration requirementof 3 months should not be assigned a diagnosis of schizophrenia, even though the combinationof persistent delusions and related hallucinations technically meets diagnostic requirements forschizophrenia. Instead, a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder is more appropriatein such cases.Boundary with moderate or severe depressive episodes in single episodedepressive disorder, recurrent depressive disorder, and bipolar type I and bipolartype II disordersPsychotic symptoms may also occur during moderate or severe depressive episodes. Delusionsduring depressive episodes may resemble delusions observed in schizophrenia, and are commonlypersecutory or self-referential (e.g. being pursued by authorities because of imaginary crimes).Delusions of guilt (e.g. falsely blaming oneself for wrongdoing), poverty (e.g. being bankrupt)or impending disaster (perceived to have been brought on by the individual), as well as somaticdelusions (e.g. of having contracted some serious disease) and nihilistic delusions (e.g. believingbody organs do not exist), are also known to occur. Experiences of passivity, influence or control(e.g. thought insertion, thought withdrawal or thought broadcasting) may also occur in moderate orsevere depressive episodes. Hallucinations are usually transient, and rarely occur in the absence ofSchizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia 170 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersdelusions. Auditory hallucinations (e.g. derogatory or accusatory voices that berate the individual forimaginary weaknesses or sins) are more common than visual (e.g. visions of death or destruction) orolfactory (e.g. the smell of rotting flesh) hallucinations. However, in a moderate or severe depressiveepisode with psychotic symptoms, the psychotic symptoms are confined to the mood episode.Schizophrenia is differentiated from depressive episodes in mood disorders by the occurrence ofpsychotic and other symptoms that meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia duringperiods without mood symptoms that meet the diagnostic requirements of a moderate or severedepressive episode. If the diagnostic requirements for both schizophrenia and a moderate or severedepressive episode are met concurrently, and both the psychotic and mood symptoms last for atleast 1 month, schizoaffective disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.Boundary with manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I disorderPsychotic symptoms may occur during manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I disorder. Thoughall types of psychotic symptoms are known to occur in manic or mixed episodes, grandiose delusions(e.g. being chosen by God, having special powers or abilities) and persecutory and self-referentialdelusions (e.g. being conspired against because of one’s special identity or abilities) are amongthe most common. Experiences of influence, passivity or control (e.g. thought insertion, thoughtwithdrawal or thought broadcasting) may also occur during manic or mixed episodes. Hallucinationsare less frequent and commonly accompany delusions of persecution or reference. They are usuallyauditory (e.g. adulatory voices), and less commonly visual (e.g. visions of deities), somatic or tactile.However, in a manic or mixed episode with psychotic symptoms, the psychotic symptoms areconfined to the mood episode. Schizophrenia is differentiated from manic or mixed episodes inbipolar type I disorder by the occurrence of psychotic and other symptoms that meet the diagnosticrequirements of schizophrenia during periods without mood symptoms that meet the diagnosticrequirements of a manic or mixed episode. If the diagnostic requirements for both schizophreniaand bipolar type I disorder are met concurrently, and both psychotic and mood symptoms last forat least 1 month, schizoaffective disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumaticstress disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, severe flashbacksthat involve a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings may occur, intrusive imagesor memories may have a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach proportions thatappear to be paranoid. However, the diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and complexpost-traumatic stress disorder require a history of exposure to an event or series of events (eithershort- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening or horrific nature. These diagnoses also requirere-experiencing of the traumatic event in the present, in which the event is not just remembered butrather experienced as occurring again in the here and now, and may include loss of awareness andhallucination-like experiences within this specific context. Re-experiencing of traumatic events is nota characteristic feature of schizophrenia. However, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophreniafrequently co-occur, and both diagnoses should be assigned when the diagnostic requirements foreach are met.","Schizophrenia, episode unspecified","Schizophrenia, episode unspecifiedAdditional clinical features• The onset of schizophrenia may be acute, with serious disturbance apparent within a fewdays, or insidious, with a gradual development of signs and symptoms.• A prodromal phase often precedes the onset of psychotic symptoms by weeks or months.The characteristic features of this phase often include loss of interest in work or socialactivities, neglect of personal appearance or hygiene, inversion of the sleep cycle andattenuated psychotic symptoms, accompanied by negative symptoms, anxiety/agitation orvarying degrees of depressive symptoms.• Between acute episodes there may be residual phases, which are similar phenomenologicallyto the prodromal phase.• Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and significant impairmentin personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas offunctioning. However, distress and psychosocial impairment are not requirements for adiagnosis of schizophrenia.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Psychotic-like symptoms or unusual subjective experiences may occur in the generalpopulation, but these are usually fleeting in nature and are not accompanied by otherSchizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders 167symptoms of schizophrenia or a deterioration in psychosocial functioning. In schizophrenia,multiple persistent symptoms are present, and are typically accompanied by impairment incognitive functioning and other psychosocial problems.Course features• The course and onset of schizophrenia is variable. Some experience exacerbations andremission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others experience a gradualworsening of symptoms, and a smaller proportion experience complete remission ofsymptoms.• Positive symptoms tend to diminish naturally over time, whereas negative symptoms oftenpersist and are closely tied to a poorer prognosis. Cognitive symptoms also tend to be morepersistent, and when present are associated with ongoing functional impairment.• Early-onset schizophrenia is typically associated with a poorer prognosis whereas affectiveand social functioning are more likely to be preserved with later onset.Developmental presentations• Onset of fully symptomatic schizophrenia before puberty is extremely rare; when it occursit is often preceded by a decline in social and academic functioning, odd behaviour,and a change in affect observable during the prodromal phase. Childhood onset is alsoassociated with a greater prevalence of delays in social, language or motor developmentand co-occurring disorder of intellectual development or developmental learning disorder.• In children and young adolescents, auditory hallucinations most commonly occuras a single voice commenting on or commanding behaviour whereas in adults suchhallucinations are more typically experienced as multiple conversing voices.• In children and adolescents, it may be challenging to differentiate delusions andhallucinations from more developmentally typical phenomena (e.g. a monster underthe child’s bed, an imaginary friend), actual plausible life experiences (e.g. being teasedor bullied at school), and irrational or magical thinking common in childhood (e.g. thatthinking about something will make it happen).• Among children with schizophrenia, negative symptoms, hallucinations and disorganizedthinking – including loose associations, illogical thinking and paucity of speech – tend tobe prominent features of the clinical presentation. Disorganized thinking and behaviouroccur in a variety of disorders that are common in childhood (e.g. autism spectrumdisorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), which should be considered beforeattributing the symptoms to the much less common childhood schizophrenia.Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia 168 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• Cultural factors may influence the onset, symptom pattern, course and outcomeof schizophrenia. For example, among migrants and ethnic and cultural minoritycommunities, living in areas with a low proportion of their own migrant, ethnic or culturalgroup (low ethnic density) is associated with higher rates of schizophrenia. In addition,etiological or course-related factors may be affected by culture at the level of the family(e.g. level of family support or style of family interaction, such as expressed emotion) or atthe societal context (e.g. industrialization, urbanization). For example, the prevalence ofschizophrenia is much higher in urban than rural settings.• The risk of misdiagnosing the expression of distress as indicative of schizophreniaor another primary psychotic disorder may be increased among ethnic minority andimmigrant groups, and in other situations in which the clinician is unfamiliar withculturally normative expressions of distress. These include situations involving spiritualor supernatural beliefs or resulting from migration trauma, social isolation, minority andacculturative stress, discrimination and victimization.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Schizophrenia is more prevalent among males.• The age of onset of the first psychotic episode differs by gender, with a greater proportionof males experiencing onset in their early to mid-20s and females in their late 20s.• Females with schizophrenia tend to report more positive symptoms that increase in severityover the course of their lives. Females also tend to have greater mood disturbance and agreater prevalence of subsequent or co-occurring mental disorders (e.g. schizoaffectivedisorder, depressive disorders).• Females with schizophrenia are less likely to exhibit disorganized thinking, negativesymptoms and social impairment.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with schizoaffective disorderThe diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are intended to apply to the currentor most recent episode of the disorder. In other words, a previous diagnosis of schizoaffectivedisorder does not preclude a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and vice versa. In both schizophrenia andschizoaffective disorder, at least two the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia are present most ofthe time for a period of 1 month or more. In schizoaffective disorder, the symptoms of schizophreniaare present concurrently with mood symptoms that meet the full diagnostic requirements of amood episode and last for at least 1 month, and the onsets of the psychotic and mood symptomsare either simultaneous or occur within a few days of one another.

(See mood episode descriptions, p. 212.) An episode that initially meets the diagnosticrequirements for schizoaffective disorder in which only the mood symptoms remit, so that theduration of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms is much longer than the duration ofconcurrent symptoms, may be best characterized as an episode of schizophrenia.Boundary with acute and transient psychotic disorderThe psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia persist for at least 1 month in their full, florid form.In contrast, the symptoms in acute and transient psychotic disorder tend to fluctuate rapidly inintensity and type across time, such that the content and focus of delusions or hallucinations oftenshift, even on a daily basis. Such rapid shifts would be unusual in schizophrenia. Negative symptomsare often present in schizophrenia, but do not occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder. Theduration of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, and most often lastsfrom a few days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for schizophrenia. In casesthat meet the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia except that they have lasted less than theduration required for a diagnosis (i.e. 1 month) in the absence of a previous history of schizophrenia,a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder and not acute and transient psychoticdisorder should be assigned.Boundary with schizotypal disorderSchizotypal disorder is characterized by an enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions,beliefs and behaviours that resemble attenuated forms of the defining symptoms of schizophrenia.Schizophrenia is differentiated from schizotypal disorder based entirely on the intensity ofthe symptoms: schizophrenia is diagnosed if the symptoms are sufficiently intense to meetdiagnostic requirements.Boundary with delusional disorderBoth schizophrenia and delusional disorder may be characterized by persistent delusions.

37,6A22,Schizotypal disorder,"Schizotypal disorder is characterised by an enduring pattern (i.e. characteristic of the person’s functioning over a period of at least several years) of eccentricities in behaviour, appearance and speech, accompanied by cognitive and perceptual distortions, unusual beliefs, and discomfort with— and often reduced capacity for— interpersonal relationships. Symptoms may include constricted or inappropriate affect and anhedonia. Paranoid ideas, ideas of reference, or other psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations in any modality, may occur, but are not of sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder. The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.",Schizotypal personality disorder,Autism spectrum disorder; Personality disorder,"Schizotypal disorderEssential (required) features• An enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions, beliefs and behaviours that are notof sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder is required for diagnosis. The patternincludes several of the following symptoms:• constricted affect, such that the individual appears cold and aloof;• behaviour or appearance that is odd, eccentric, unusual or peculiar, and is inconsistentwith cultural or subcultural norms;• poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal;• unusual beliefs or magical thinking influencing the person’s behaviour in ways that areinconsistent with subcultural norms, but not reaching the diagnostic requirements fora delusion;• unusual perceptual distortions such as intense illusions, depersonalization, derealization,or auditory or other hallucinations;• suspiciousness or paranoid ideas;• vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate or stereotyped thinking, manifestedin odd speech without gross incoherence;• obsessive ruminations without a sense that the obsession is foreign or unwanted, oftenwith body dysmorphic, sexual or aggressive content.• The individual has never met the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia, schizoaffectivedisorder or delusional disorder. That is, transient delusions, hallucinations, formal thoughtdisorder, or experiences of influence, passivity or control may occur, but do not last formore than 1 month.• Symptoms should have been present, continuously or episodically, for at least 2 years.• The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. corticosteroids) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol) – and are not betteraccounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder.Additional clinical features• Schizotypal disorder is more prevalent among biological relatives of people with a diagnosisof schizophrenia, and is considered to be a part of the spectrum of schizophrenia-relatedpsychopathology. Having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia gives additionalweight to a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder but is not a requirement if the individual isexperiencing distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning related to their symptoms.Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizotypal disorder 178 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with normality (threshold)• The threshold between symptoms of schizotypal disorder and extravagant, eccentric orunusual behaviour and beliefs in individuals without a diagnosable disorder is sometimesdifficult to determine, especially as some people in the general population show eccentricbehaviour and report psychotic-like or unusual subjective experiences without anyapparent impairment in functioning. Schizotypal disorder should only be diagnosed if theindividual is experiencing distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning related to their symptoms.Course features• The course of schizotypal disorder is relatively stable and chronic, with some fluctuationin symptom intensity. Individuals often have severe functional impairments in academic,occupational and interpersonal domains.• The following symptoms of schizotypal disorder are typically present prior to fullsymptomatic onset:• poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal, suspiciousness orparanoid ideas;• vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate or stereotyped thinking, manifestedin odd speech without gross incoherence.• The disorder may persist over years with fluctuations of intensity and symptom expression,but rarely evolves into schizophrenia.• Affected individuals typically seek treatment for co-occurring depressive or anxiety andfear-related disorders. Although intervention has demonstrated some efficacy in improvingmood and anxiety symptoms, suspicion and paranoia often persist.Developmental presentations• Schizotypal disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, without adefinite age of onset.• Some symptoms of schizotypal disorder may first appear in childhood and adolescence,affecting peer relationships and academic performance.Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizotypal disorder Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders 179Culture-related features• A person’s behaviour, appearance, speech or illness explanations may appear odd orunusual to clinicians who are unfamiliar with the person’s culture, but in the context ofthe person’s cultural group may be either normative or not sufficiently severe to reachthe threshold of a mental disorder. Concepts and experiences that are common in somecultures include witchcraft or sorcery, speaking in tongues, life beyond death, shamanism,mind reading, sixth sense, evil eye, spirit possession and magical beliefs related to healthand illness.• Reduced engagement in interpersonal relationships may be part of some cultural orreligious practices (e.g. monastic isolation) and should not be considered pathological.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Schizotypal disorder is slightly more prevalent among males.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with schizophreniaIn the prodromal and residual phases of schizophrenia, the individual may experience extendedperiods of perceptual distortions, unusual beliefs, odd or digressive speech, social withdrawaland other symptoms that are characteristic of schizotypal disorder. A diagnosis of schizophrenia,however, requires a period of at least 1 month of psychotic symptoms, in contrast to schizotypaldisorder, which requires that any psychotic-like symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirementsfor schizophrenia in terms of severity or duration.

However,if additional personality features are present that are judged to produce significant problems ininterpersonal functioning, an additional diagnosis of personality disorder may be appropriate.",Schizotypal disorder,"Disorder Name: Schizotypal disorderDisorder Code: 6A22Disorder symptoms: Schizotypal disorder is characterised by an enduring pattern (i.e. characteristic of the person’s functioning over a period of at least several years) of eccentricities in behaviour, appearance and speech, accompanied by cognitive and perceptual distortions, unusual beliefs, and discomfort with— and often reduced capacity for— interpersonal relationships. Symptoms may include constricted or inappropriate affect and anhedonia. Paranoid ideas, ideas of reference, or other psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations in any modality, may occur, but are not of sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder. The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.If you have Schizotypal personality disorder other inclusions could be: Schizotypal personality disorderIf you diagnose this disease exclude: Autism spectrum disorder; Personality disorderSchizotypal disorderEssential (required) features• An enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions, beliefs and behaviours that are notof sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder is required for diagnosis. The patternincludes several of the following symptoms:• constricted affect, such that the individual appears cold and aloof;• behaviour or appearance that is odd, eccentric, unusual or peculiar, and is inconsistentwith cultural or subcultural norms;• poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal;• unusual beliefs or magical thinking influencing the person’s behaviour in ways that areinconsistent with subcultural norms, but not reaching the diagnostic requirements fora delusion;• unusual perceptual distortions such as intense illusions, depersonalization, derealization,or auditory or other hallucinations;• suspiciousness or paranoid ideas;• vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate or stereotyped thinking, manifestedin odd speech without gross incoherence;• obsessive ruminations without a sense that the obsession is foreign or unwanted, oftenwith body dysmorphic, sexual or aggressive content.• The individual has never met the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia, schizoaffectivedisorder or delusional disorder. That is, transient delusions, hallucinations, formal thoughtdisorder, or experiences of influence, passivity or control may occur, but do not last formore than 1 month.• Symptoms should have been present, continuously or episodically, for at least 2 years.• The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. corticosteroids) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol) – and are not betteraccounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder.Additional clinical features• Schizotypal disorder is more prevalent among biological relatives of people with a diagnosisof schizophrenia, and is considered to be a part of the spectrum of schizophrenia-relatedpsychopathology. Having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia gives additionalweight to a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder but is not a requirement if the individual isexperiencing distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning related to their symptoms.Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizotypal disorder 178 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with normality (threshold)• The threshold between symptoms of schizotypal disorder and extravagant, eccentric orunusual behaviour and beliefs in individuals without a diagnosable disorder is sometimesdifficult to determine, especially as some people in the general population show eccentricbehaviour and report psychotic-like or unusual subjective experiences without anyapparent impairment in functioning. Schizotypal disorder should only be diagnosed if theindividual is experiencing distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning related to their symptoms.Course features• The course of schizotypal disorder is relatively stable and chronic, with some fluctuationin symptom intensity. Individuals often have severe functional impairments in academic,occupational and interpersonal domains.• The following symptoms of schizotypal disorder are typically present prior to fullsymptomatic onset:• poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal, suspiciousness orparanoid ideas;• vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate or stereotyped thinking, manifestedin odd speech without gross incoherence.• The disorder may persist over years with fluctuations of intensity and symptom expression,but rarely evolves into schizophrenia.• Affected individuals typically seek treatment for co-occurring depressive or anxiety andfear-related disorders. Although intervention has demonstrated some efficacy in improvingmood and anxiety symptoms, suspicion and paranoia often persist.Developmental presentations• Schizotypal disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, without adefinite age of onset.• Some symptoms of schizotypal disorder may first appear in childhood and adolescence,affecting peer relationships and academic performance.Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizotypal disorder Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders 179Culture-related features• A person’s behaviour, appearance, speech or illness explanations may appear odd orunusual to clinicians who are unfamiliar with the person’s culture, but in the context ofthe person’s cultural group may be either normative or not sufficiently severe to reachthe threshold of a mental disorder. Concepts and experiences that are common in somecultures include witchcraft or sorcery, speaking in tongues, life beyond death, shamanism,mind reading, sixth sense, evil eye, spirit possession and magical beliefs related to healthand illness.• Reduced engagement in interpersonal relationships may be part of some cultural orreligious practices (e.g. monastic isolation) and should not be considered pathological.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Schizotypal disorder is slightly more prevalent among males.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with schizophreniaIn the prodromal and residual phases of schizophrenia, the individual may experience extendedperiods of perceptual distortions, unusual beliefs, odd or digressive speech, social withdrawaland other symptoms that are characteristic of schizotypal disorder. A diagnosis of schizophrenia,however, requires a period of at least 1 month of psychotic symptoms, in contrast to schizotypaldisorder, which requires that any psychotic-like symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirementsfor schizophrenia in terms of severity or duration. Moreover, the pattern of unusual speech,perceptions, beliefs and behaviours tends to be stable over time – even over years – in individualswith schizotypal disorder, in contrast to an evolving symptom picture either in prodromal or residualphases of schizophrenia.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderInterpersonal difficulties seen in schizotypal disorder may share some features of autism spectrumdisorder, including poor rapport with others and social withdrawal.

After this initial period, if the number and severity of symptoms reaches thediagnostic threshold for a depressive episode in the context of an ongoing dysthymic disorder,both dysthymic disorder and either single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressivedisorder may be diagnosed. Unlike dysthymic disorder, recurrent depressive disorder is episodicin nature.

Dysthymic disorder is differentiated by the presence of lowmood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and other characteristic symptomsof dysthymic disorder (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, recurrent thoughts ofdeath). In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals are focused on potential negative outcomesthat might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, work) rather thanthoughts of worthlessness or hopelessness. Rumination often occurs in the context of dysthymicdisorder but, unlike in generalized anxiety disorder, is not usually accompanied by persistentworry and apprehension about various everyday aspects of life. Generalized anxiety disorder mayco-occur with dysthymic disorder, but should only be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirementsfor generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to the onset of dysthymic disorder.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIt is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance andsymptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of mood disturbance.

This is in contrast to premenstrualdysphoric disorder, in which the symptoms are considerably more severe and cause significantdistress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning.Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders,including mood disorders that are exacerbated premenstruallyMood symptoms characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder – including depressed mood,irritability and anxiety – can be present in other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmentaldisorders (e.g. depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, generalized anxiety disorder). Althoughsymptoms of these disorders may be exacerbated during the late luteal and menstrual phases,premenstrual dysphoric disorder is differentiated by the absence of symptoms 1 week followingthe onset of menses. Because of the difficulty in accurate recall of the relationship betweenmenstrual cycle and the course of symptoms, prospective mood ratings for two consecutive cyclesshould be considered.Boundary with dysmenorrhoeaDysmenorrhoea is characterized by cyclic pelvic pain or lower, umbilical or suprapubicabdominal pain preceding or accompanying menstruation that interferes with daily activities.Unlike premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the onset of dysmenorrhoea is coincident with the startof rather than prior to menses. Furthermore, mood symptoms are not typically associated withthis condition.Mood disorders | Depressive disorder, unspecified Mood disorders 263Boundary with the effects of hormones and their synthetic substitutes andantagonistsUse of hormone treatments, including for contraceptive purposes, may result in unwanted side-effects that include mood, somatic and cognitive symptoms.

120,6A8Z,"Mood disorders, unspecified",,,,"Mood disorder, unspecifiedThe sections that follow describe the characteristics of mood episodes. After that, the CDDR areprovided for the diagnostic categories of mood disorders.Mood episode descriptionsDepressive episodeEssential (required) features• The concurrent presence of at least five of the following characteristic symptoms occurringfor most of the day, nearly every day, during a period lasting at least 2 weeks is requiredfor diagnosis. At least one symptom from the affective cluster must be present. Assessmentof the presence or absence of symptoms should be made relative to typical functioning ofthe individual.Affective cluster• Depressed mood as reported by the individual (e.g. feeling down, sad) or as observed(e.g. tearful, defeated appearance) (Note: in children and adolescents depressed moodcan manifest as irritability.)• Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities, especially those normally foundto be enjoyable to the individual (Note: this may include a reduction in sexual desire.)Cognitive-behavioural cluster• Reduced ability to concentrate and sustain attention on tasks, or marked indecisiveness• Beliefs of low self-worth or excessive and inappropriate guilt that may be manifestlydelusional (Note: this item should not be considered present if guilt or self-reproach isexclusively about being depressed.)• Hopelessness about the future• Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation (with orwithout a specific plan), or evidence of attempted suicideMood disorders | Depressive episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 213Neurovegetative cluster• Significantly disrupted sleep (delayed sleep onset, increased frequency of waking duringthe night, or early morning awakening) or excessive sleep• Significant change in appetite (diminished or increased) or significant weight change(gain or loss)• Psychomotor agitation or retardation (observable by others, not merely subjective feelingsof restlessness or being slowed down)• Reduced energy, fatigue or marked tiredness following the expenditure of only a minimumof effort• The symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).• The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.• The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social,educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning ismaintained, it is only through significant additional effort.Additional clinical features• In some individuals, the affective component of a depressive episode may be primarilyexperienced and expressed as irritability, or as an absence of emotional experience (e.g.emptiness). These variants in the expression of the affective component can be consideredas meeting the depressed mood requirement for a depressive episode if they represent asignificant change from the individual’s typical functioning.• In some individuals – particularly those experiencing a severe depressive episode – theremay be reluctance to describe certain experiences (e.g. psychotic symptoms) or inabilityto do so in detail (e.g. due to psychomotor agitation or retardation). In such cases,observations made by the clinician or reported by a collateral informant are important indetermining the diagnostic status and severity of the episode.• Depressive episodes may be associated with increased consumption of alcohol orother substances, exacerbation of pre-existing psychological symptoms (e.g. phobic orobsessional symptoms) or somatic preoccupations.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Some depression of mood is a normal reaction to severe adverse life events and problems (e.g.divorce, job loss), and is common in the community. A depressive episode is differentiatedfrom this common experience by the severity, range and duration of symptoms. If thediagnostic requirements for a depressive episode listed above are met, a depressive episodeshould still be considered present, even if there are identifiable life events that appear tohave triggered the episode.Mood disorders | Depressive episode 214 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• A depressive episode should not be considered to be present if the individual is exhibitingnormal grief symptoms, including some level of depressive symptoms, and the individualhas experienced the death of a loved one within the past 6 months, or longer if a moreextended period of bereavement is consistent with the normative response for grievingwithin the individual’s religious and cultural context. Individuals with no history ofdepressive episodes may experience depressive symptoms during bereavement, but thisdoes not appear to indicate an increased risk of subsequently developing a mood disorder.However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on normal grief. The presence of adepressive episode during a period of bereavement is suggested by persistence of constantdepressive symptoms 1 month or more following the loss (i.e. there are no periods ofpositive mood or enjoyment of activities); severe depressive symptoms, such as extremebeliefs of low self-worth and guilt not related to the lost loved one; or presence of psychoticsymptoms, suicidal ideation or psychomotor retardation. A prior history of depressivedisorder or bipolar disorder is important to consider in making this distinction.Developmental presentations• Depressive episodes are relatively rare in childhood, and occur with similar frequencyamong boys and girls. Rates increase significantly after puberty, and girls are approximatelytwice as likely as boys to experience a depressive episode.• All the characteristic features of a depressive episode can be observed in children andadolescents. As in adults, symptoms of a depressive episode should represent a change fromprior functioning. Assessment of a depressive episode in younger children in particular islikely to rely on the report of other informants (e.g. parents) regarding signs and symptomsand the extent to which these represent a change from prior functioning.Affective cluster• In young children, depressed mood may present as somatic complaints (e.g. headaches,stomach pains), whining, increased separation anxiety or excessive crying. Depressedmood may sometimes present in children and adolescents as pervasive irritability.However, the presence of irritability is not in and of itself indicative of a depressive episodeand may indicate the presence of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmentaldisorder, or be a normal reaction to frustration.Cognitive-behavioural cluster• As noted, reduced ability to concentrate or sustain attention may manifest as a declinein academic performance, increased time needed to complete school assignments oran inability to complete assignments. These symptoms of a depressive episode mustbe differentiated from problems with attention and concentration in attention deficithyperactivity disorder that are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy.Neurovegetative cluster• Hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more common symptoms of a depressive episode inadolescents than in adults. Appetite disturbance in children and adolescents may manifestin failure to gain weight as expected for age and development rather than as weight loss.• As with adults, children and adolescents experiencing a depressive episode are at increasedrisk of suicidality. In younger children, suicidality may manifest in passive statements (e.g.I don’t want to be here any more) or as themes of death during play, whereas adolescentsmay make more direct statements regarding their desire to die.Mood disorders | Depressive episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 215• Self-injurious behaviours that are not explicitly suicidal in terms of lethality or expressedintent may also occur in a depressive episode in young children and adolescents.Examples include head banging or scratching in young children and cutting or burningin adolescents. If unaddressed, these types of behaviours tend to increase in frequencyand intensity over time among children and adolescents with depressive disorders.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with mixed episodeDepressive symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a depressiveepisode, but in a mixed episode several prominent depressive symptoms occur simultaneously oralternate rapidly with several prominent manic symptoms such as irritability, racing or crowdedthoughts, increased talkativeness or increased activity.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderProblems with attention and concentration in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are persistentover time (i.e. are not episodic) and are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy. However,mood disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses maybe assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.Boundary with prolonged grief disorderProlonged grief disorder is a persistent and pervasive grief response following the death of a partner,parent, child or other person close to the bereaved that persists for an abnormally long period oftime following the loss (e.g. at least 6 months). It is characterized by longing for the deceased orpersistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness,guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self,inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social orother activities). Some common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder are similar to those observedin a depressive episode (e.g. sadness, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, feelings of guilt,suicidal ideation). However, prolonged grief disorder is differentiated from a depressive episodebecause symptoms are circumscribed and specifically focused on the loss of the loved one, whereasdepressive thoughts and emotional reactions typically encompass multiple areas of life. Further,other common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder (e.g. difficulty accepting the loss, difficultytrusting others, feeling bitter or angry about the loss, feeling as though a part of the individual hasdied) are not characteristic of a depressive episode. The timing of the onset of the symptoms inrelation to the loss and whether there is a prior history of a depressive disorder or a bipolar disorderare important to consider in making this distinction.Boundary with dementiaOlder adults experiencing a depressive episode may present with memory difficulties and othercognitive symptoms, which can be severe, and it is important to distinguish these symptomsfrom dementia. Dementia is an acquired chronic condition characterized by significant cognitiveimpairment or decline from a previous level of cognitive functioning in two or more cognitivedomains (e.g. memory, attention, executive function, language, social cognition, psychomotor speed,visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to interfere with performanceor independence in activities of daily living. If memory difficulties and other cognitive symptomsin older adults occur exclusively in the context of a depressive episode, a diagnosis of dementiais generally not appropriate. However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on dementia(e.g. when memory difficulties and other cognitive symptoms substantially predate the onsetMood disorders | Depressive episode 216 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersof the depressive episode). The timing and rate of onset of the memory difficulties and othercognitive symptoms in relation to other depressive symptoms are important to consider in makingthis distinction.Severity and psychotic symptoms specifiersThe severity of all current depressive episodes should be rated based on the number and severity ofthe symptoms, as well as the impact that the mood disturbance has on the individual’s functioning.In addition, moderate and severe depressive episodes are described as without psychoticsymptoms (i.e. delusions or hallucinations) or with psychotic symptoms. By definition, milddepressive episodes do not include psychotic symptoms.Delusions during moderate or severe depressive episodes are commonly persecutory or self-referential (e.g. being pursued by authorities because of imaginary crimes). In addition,delusions of guilt (e.g. falsely blaming oneself for wrongdoing), poverty (e.g. being bankrupt)and impending disaster (perceived to have been brought on by the individual), as well as somatic(e.g. of having contracted some serious disease) or nihilistic delusions (e.g. believing bodyorgans do not exist) are known to occur. Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivityor control (e.g. the experience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are beingplaced in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are beingbroadcast to others) can also occur, but less commonly than in schizophrenia and schizoaffectivedisorder. Auditory hallucinations (e.g. derogatory or accusatory voices that berate the patient forsupposed weaknesses or sins) are more common than visual (e.g. visions of death or destruction)or olfactory hallucinations (e.g. the smell of rotting flesh).Psychotic symptoms are often subtle, and the boundary between psychotic symptoms andpersistent depressive ruminations or sustained preoccupations is not always clear. Psychoticsymptoms may vary in intensity over the course of a depressive episode or even over the courseof the day. Psychotic symptoms may be intentionally concealed by individuals experiencinga depressive episode.Mild depressive episode• None of the symptoms of a depressive episode should be present to an intense degree.• The individual is usually distressed by the symptoms, and has some difficulty in continuingto function in one of more domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupationalor other important domains).• There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Moderate depressive episode without psychotic symptoms• Several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a largenumber of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.• The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains(personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Moderate depressive episode with psychotic symptoms• Several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a largenumber of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.Mood disorders | Depressive episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 217• The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains(personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms• Many or most symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, ora smaller number of symptoms are present and manifest to an intense degree.• The individual has serious difficulty continuing to function in most domains (personal,family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms• Many or most symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, ora smaller number of symptoms are present and manifest to an intense degree.• The individual has serious difficulty continuing to function in most domains (personal,family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Manic episodeEssential (required) features• Both of the following features occur concurrently and persist for most of the day, nearlyevery day, during a period of at least 1 week, unless shortened by a treatment intervention.• An extreme mood state is observable or reported, characterized by euphoria, irritabilityor expansiveness that represents a significant change from the individual’s typical mood.Individuals commonly exhibit rapid changes among different mood states (i.e. moodlability).• Increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy is present, and representsa significant change from the individual’s typical level.• Several of the following symptoms are present, representing a significant change from theindividual’s usual behaviour or subjective state:• increased talkativeness or pressured speech (a feeling of internal pressure to bemore talkative);• flight of ideas or experience of rapid or racing thoughts (e.g. thoughts flow rapidly and,in some cases, illogically from one idea to the next; the person reports that their thoughtsare rapid or even racing and has difficulty remaining on topic);• increased self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g. the individual believes that they can accomplishtasks well beyond their skill level, or that they are about to become famous – in psychoticpresentations of mania, this may be manifested in grandiose delusions);• decreased need for sleep (e.g. the person reports being able to function with only2 or 3 hours of sleep), as distinct from insomnia, in which an individual wants to sleepbut cannot;Mood disorders | Manic episode 218 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• distractibility (e.g. the person cannot stay on task, because attention is drawn to irrelevantor minor environmental stimuli, such as being overly distracted by outside noise duringa conversation);• impulsive reckless behaviour (e.g. the individual impulsively pursues pleasurable activitieswithout regard to their potential for negative consequences, or impulsively makes majordecisions in the absence of adequate planning);• an increase in sexual drive, sociability or goal-directed activity.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. cocaine, amfetamines), including withdrawal effects.• The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.• The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social,educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, requires intensivetreatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, or is accompanied bydelusions or hallucinations.Additional clinical features• Manic episodes may or may not include psychotic symptoms. A wide variety of psychoticsymptoms may occur in mania; among the most common are grandiose delusions (e.g.being chosen by God, having special powers or abilities), persecutory delusions andself-referential delusions (e.g. being conspired against because of one’s special identityor abilities). Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivity or control (e.g. theexperience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’smind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcastto others) may also occur. Hallucinations are less frequent, and commonly accompanydelusions of persecution or reference. They are usually auditory (e.g. adulatory voices), andless commonly visual (e.g. visions of deities), somatic or tactile.• Some patients may exhibit symptoms or impairment in functioning that is sufficientlysevere to require immediate intervention (e.g. treatment with mood-stabilizingmedications). As a result, their symptoms may not meet the full duration requirement ofa manic episode. Episodes that meet the full symptom requirements but last for less than1 week because they are shortened by a treatment intervention should still be consideredmanic episodes.• A manic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should beconsidered a manic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued andthe full diagnostic requirements of a manic episode are met after the direct physiologicaleffects of the treatment are likely to have receded.Mood disorders | Manic episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 219Boundary with normality (threshold)• Periods of euphoric or irritable mood that are entirely contextually appropriate (e.g. euphoriaafter winning a lottery) should not be considered as meeting the mood component of thediagnostic requirements for a manic episode.Developmental presentations• Manic episodes are rare in childhood and adolescence. It is normal for children to displayoverexcitement, exuberance or silliness in contexts such as special occasions, celebrations orsome types of play. A manic episode should only be considered when these behaviours areepisodic and recurrent (or characterized by rapid onset if a first episode), are inappropriatefor the context in which they arise, are in excess of what might be expected given theperson’s age or developmental level, represent a distinct change from previous functioning,and are associated with significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational orother important areas of functioning.• When a manic episode occurs in children or adolescents, all the characteristic features canbe observed. The reports of other informants (e.g. parents) are particularly important in thecase of children in evaluating the nature of symptoms and the extent to which they representa change from previous functioning. The extreme mood state characteristic of a manicepisode may manifest as extreme irritability in children and adolescents. Younger childrenmay exhibit excessive or severe tantrums or increased physical aggression (e.g. throwingthings or hitting).• In children and adolescents, increased distractibility may manifest as a decline in academicperformance, increased time needed to complete school assignments or an inability tocomplete assignments.• Increased self-esteem or grandiosity associated with a manic episode should bedifferentiated from children’s normal tendency to overestimate their abilities and believethat they have special talents. Grandiose beliefs that are held with clear evidence to thecontrary or acted on in such a way that they place the child in danger are more suggestive ofa manic episode. Examples of manifestations of grandiosity include magical or unrealisticideas (e.g. thinking they can fly) in younger children or overestimation of abilities ortalents based on current functioning (e.g. believing they should coach their high schoolsports team) in adolescents.• Specific manifestations of increased goal-directed activities associated with a manicepisode may differ across ages. For example, a younger child might build elaborate projectswith blocks, while an adolescent might disassemble electronics or appliances.• As in adults, children and adolescents may engage in impulsive reckless behaviours duringa manic episode, but these are likely to present differently in children and adolescentsbased on behavioural repertoire and access to specific activities. For example, a child mayexhibit risky play, disregarding possible injury (e.g. running into a busy street, climbing atall tree, trying to fly), whereas for adolescents, analogous behaviour may include drivingfast, spending excessively or engaging in risky sexual behaviour.Mood disorders | Manic episode 220 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with hypomanic episodeThe symptoms of manic episodes may be qualitatively similar to those of hypomanic episodes but,unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to result in significantimpairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas offunctioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others,or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.Boundary with mixed episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a manic episode, but ina mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly withseveral prominent depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness,hopelessness or suicidal ideation.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderMany features of a manic episode – such as increased activity, rapid speech and over-talkativeness,distractibility and impulsivity – can be observed in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. Differentiating between these disorders can be particularly challenging among childrenand adolescents. However, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, symptoms have their onsetbefore the age of 12 years, are persistent over time (i.e. are not episodic), and are not temporallytied to changes in mood or energy (e.g. are not accompanied by intense mood elevation). However,rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are substantially elevated compared to the generalpopulation among children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorders, and both diagnosesmay be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.Mixed episodeEssential (required) features• Several prominent manic and several prominent depressive symptoms consistent withthose observed in manic episodes and depressive episodes are present, which eitheroccur simultaneously or alternate very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day).Symptoms must include an altered mood state consistent with a manic and/or depressiveepisode (i.e. depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive mood), and be present mostof the day, nearly every day, during a period of at least 2 weeks, unless shortened by atreatment intervention.• When manic symptoms predominate in a mixed episode, common depressive (contrapolar)symptoms are dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, hopelessness andsuicidal ideation.• When depressive symptoms predominate in a mixed episode, common manic (contrapolar)symptoms are irritability, racing or crowded thoughts, increased talkativeness andincreased activity.Mood disorders | Mixed episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 221• When depressive and manic symptoms alternate rapidly during a mixed episode, suchfluctuations may be observed in mood (e.g. between euphoria and sadness or dysphoria),emotional reactivity (e.g. between flat affect and intense or exaggerated reactiveness toemotional stimuli), drive (e.g. alternating periods of increased and decreased activity,verbal expression, sexual desire or appetite) and cognitive functioning (e.g. periods ofactivation and inhibition or slowing of thoughts, attention and memory).• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from cocaine).• The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social,educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, or is accompanied bydelusions or hallucinations.Additional clinical features• Delusions and hallucinations characteristic of both depressive and manic episodes (seeabove) can occur in mixed episodes.• A mixed syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should beconsidered a mixed episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued andthe full diagnostic requirements of a mixed episode are met after the direct physiologicaleffects of the treatment are likely to have receded.Developmental presentations• Research regarding mixed episodes in children and adolescents is limited; however, someevidence suggests that adolescents with bipolar disorders may be more likely than adultswith bipolar disorders to experience mixed episodes.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with manic episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a manic episode, butin a mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidlywith several depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness,hopelessness or suicidal ideation.Mood disorders | Mixed episode 222 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with depressive episodeDepressive symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a depressiveepisode, but in a mixed episode several prominent depressive symptoms occur simultaneously oralternate rapidly with several prominent manic symptoms such as irritability, racing or crowdedthoughts, increased talkativeness or increased activity.Boundary with hypomanic episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a hypomanic episodebut, unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance in a mixed episode is sufficiently severeto result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to preventharm to self or others, or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.

This does not include periodsof elevated or irritable mood that are contextually appropriate (e.g. elevated mood aftergraduating from school or related to falling in love). Rapid shifts among different moodstates commonly occur (i.e. mood lability).• Increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy is present, and representsa significant change from the individual’s typical level.• In addition, several of the following symptoms are present, representing a significantchange from the individual’s usual behaviour (e.g. the change would be apparent to otherswho know the individual well) or subjective state:• increased talkativeness or pressured speech (a feeling of internal pressure to be moretalkative);• flight of ideas or experience of rapid or racing thoughts (e.g. thoughts flow rapidly fromone idea to the next; the person reports that their thoughts are rapid or even racing andhas difficulty remaining on a topic);• increased self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g. the individual is more self-confident than usual);• decreased need for sleep (e.g. the person reports needing less sleep than usual and still feelswell-rested), as distinct from insomnia, in which an individual wants to sleep but cannot;• distractibility (e.g. the person has difficulty staying on task, because attention is drawnto irrelevant or minor environmental stimuli, such as being overly distracted by outsidenoise during a conversation);Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 223• impulsive reckless behaviour (e.g. the individual pursues pleasurable activities with littleregard to their potential for negative consequences, or makes decisions in the absenceof adequate planning);• an increase in sexual drive, sociability or goal-directed activity.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. cocaine, amfetamines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).• The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.• The mood disturbance is not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment inoccupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others, and isnot accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.Additional clinical features• A hypomanic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (medication,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) shouldbe considered a hypomanic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment isdiscontinued and the full diagnostic requirements of a hypomanic episode are met afterthe direct physiological effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Hypomanic episodes are often difficult to distinguish from normal periods of elevatedmood – for example, related to positive life events – particularly given that hypomanicepisodes are not associated with significant functional impairment. In order to beconsidered a hypomanic episode, the symptoms must represent a significant and noticeablechange from the individual’s typical mood and behaviour.• The occurrence of one or more hypomanic episodes in the absence of a history of othertypes of mood episodes (manic, depressive or mixed episodes) is not a sufficient basis fora diagnosis of a mood disorder.Developmental presentations• As in adults, hypomanic episodes in children and adolescents are similar to – but less severethan – manic episodes, and may present for a shorter period of time. The informationin the section on developmental presentations for manic episode, above, is therefore alsoapplicable to hypomanic episode.Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode 224 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Hypomanic episodes may be difficult to distinguish from developmentally normativebehaviours in children and adolescents (e.g. changes in sleep or irritability duringadolescence). Factors to consider include the episodicity and a marked, co-occurring,change in cognitions (e.g. racing thoughts) or behaviours (e.g. increased activity level).• Increased irritability in younger children may manifest as excessive or more severetantrums or increased physical aggression (e.g. throwing things, or hitting).Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with manic episodeThe symptoms of hypomanic episodes may be qualitatively similar to those of manic episodes,but the mood disturbance is not sufficiently severe to result in marked impairment in personal,family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, or to requireintensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, and is not accompaniedby delusions or hallucinations.Boundary with mixed episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a hypomanic episodebut, unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance in a mixed episode is sufficiently severeto result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to preventharm to self or others, or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.

Differentiating between these disorders can be particularly challengingamong children and adolescents. However, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, symptomshave their onset before the age of 12 years, are persistent over time (i.e. are not episodic), and arenot temporally tied to changes in mood or energy (e.g. are not accompanied by mood elevation).However, rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are substantially elevated compared to thegeneral population among children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorders, and bothdiagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 225Bipolar and related disordersBipolar and related disorders are episodic mood disorders defined by the occurrence of manic,mixed or hypomanic episodes or symptoms. These typically alternate over the course of thesedisorders with depressive episodes or periods of depressive symptoms.Because the symptoms of bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders are substantially similarapart from the occurrence of manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I disorder and hypomanicepisodes in bipolar type II disorder, following a separate listing of the essential features for each ofthese disorders, the other CDDR sections (e.g. additional clinical features, boundaries with otherdisorders and conditions) are provided for both disorders together.","Mood disorders, unspecified","Mood disorder, unspecifiedThe sections that follow describe the characteristics of mood episodes. After that, the CDDR areprovided for the diagnostic categories of mood disorders.Mood episode descriptionsDepressive episodeEssential (required) features• The concurrent presence of at least five of the following characteristic symptoms occurringfor most of the day, nearly every day, during a period lasting at least 2 weeks is requiredfor diagnosis. At least one symptom from the affective cluster must be present. Assessmentof the presence or absence of symptoms should be made relative to typical functioning ofthe individual.Affective cluster• Depressed mood as reported by the individual (e.g. feeling down, sad) or as observed(e.g. tearful, defeated appearance) (Note: in children and adolescents depressed moodcan manifest as irritability.)• Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities, especially those normally foundto be enjoyable to the individual (Note: this may include a reduction in sexual desire.)Cognitive-behavioural cluster• Reduced ability to concentrate and sustain attention on tasks, or marked indecisiveness• Beliefs of low self-worth or excessive and inappropriate guilt that may be manifestlydelusional (Note: this item should not be considered present if guilt or self-reproach isexclusively about being depressed.)• Hopelessness about the future• Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation (with orwithout a specific plan), or evidence of attempted suicideMood disorders | Depressive episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 213Neurovegetative cluster• Significantly disrupted sleep (delayed sleep onset, increased frequency of waking duringthe night, or early morning awakening) or excessive sleep• Significant change in appetite (diminished or increased) or significant weight change(gain or loss)• Psychomotor agitation or retardation (observable by others, not merely subjective feelingsof restlessness or being slowed down)• Reduced energy, fatigue or marked tiredness following the expenditure of only a minimumof effort• The symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).• The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.• The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social,educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning ismaintained, it is only through significant additional effort.Additional clinical features• In some individuals, the affective component of a depressive episode may be primarilyexperienced and expressed as irritability, or as an absence of emotional experience (e.g.emptiness). These variants in the expression of the affective component can be consideredas meeting the depressed mood requirement for a depressive episode if they represent asignificant change from the individual’s typical functioning.• In some individuals – particularly those experiencing a severe depressive episode – theremay be reluctance to describe certain experiences (e.g. psychotic symptoms) or inabilityto do so in detail (e.g. due to psychomotor agitation or retardation). In such cases,observations made by the clinician or reported by a collateral informant are important indetermining the diagnostic status and severity of the episode.• Depressive episodes may be associated with increased consumption of alcohol orother substances, exacerbation of pre-existing psychological symptoms (e.g. phobic orobsessional symptoms) or somatic preoccupations.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Some depression of mood is a normal reaction to severe adverse life events and problems (e.g.divorce, job loss), and is common in the community. A depressive episode is differentiatedfrom this common experience by the severity, range and duration of symptoms. If thediagnostic requirements for a depressive episode listed above are met, a depressive episodeshould still be considered present, even if there are identifiable life events that appear tohave triggered the episode.Mood disorders | Depressive episode 214 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• A depressive episode should not be considered to be present if the individual is exhibitingnormal grief symptoms, including some level of depressive symptoms, and the individualhas experienced the death of a loved one within the past 6 months, or longer if a moreextended period of bereavement is consistent with the normative response for grievingwithin the individual’s religious and cultural context. Individuals with no history ofdepressive episodes may experience depressive symptoms during bereavement, but thisdoes not appear to indicate an increased risk of subsequently developing a mood disorder.However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on normal grief. The presence of adepressive episode during a period of bereavement is suggested by persistence of constantdepressive symptoms 1 month or more following the loss (i.e. there are no periods ofpositive mood or enjoyment of activities); severe depressive symptoms, such as extremebeliefs of low self-worth and guilt not related to the lost loved one; or presence of psychoticsymptoms, suicidal ideation or psychomotor retardation. A prior history of depressivedisorder or bipolar disorder is important to consider in making this distinction.Developmental presentations• Depressive episodes are relatively rare in childhood, and occur with similar frequencyamong boys and girls. Rates increase significantly after puberty, and girls are approximatelytwice as likely as boys to experience a depressive episode.• All the characteristic features of a depressive episode can be observed in children andadolescents. As in adults, symptoms of a depressive episode should represent a change fromprior functioning. Assessment of a depressive episode in younger children in particular islikely to rely on the report of other informants (e.g. parents) regarding signs and symptomsand the extent to which these represent a change from prior functioning.Affective cluster• In young children, depressed mood may present as somatic complaints (e.g. headaches,stomach pains), whining, increased separation anxiety or excessive crying. Depressedmood may sometimes present in children and adolescents as pervasive irritability.However, the presence of irritability is not in and of itself indicative of a depressive episodeand may indicate the presence of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmentaldisorder, or be a normal reaction to frustration.Cognitive-behavioural cluster• As noted, reduced ability to concentrate or sustain attention may manifest as a declinein academic performance, increased time needed to complete school assignments oran inability to complete assignments. These symptoms of a depressive episode mustbe differentiated from problems with attention and concentration in attention deficithyperactivity disorder that are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy.Neurovegetative cluster• Hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more common symptoms of a depressive episode inadolescents than in adults. Appetite disturbance in children and adolescents may manifestin failure to gain weight as expected for age and development rather than as weight loss.• As with adults, children and adolescents experiencing a depressive episode are at increasedrisk of suicidality. In younger children, suicidality may manifest in passive statements (e.g.I don’t want to be here any more) or as themes of death during play, whereas adolescentsmay make more direct statements regarding their desire to die.Mood disorders | Depressive episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 215• Self-injurious behaviours that are not explicitly suicidal in terms of lethality or expressedintent may also occur in a depressive episode in young children and adolescents.Examples include head banging or scratching in young children and cutting or burningin adolescents. If unaddressed, these types of behaviours tend to increase in frequencyand intensity over time among children and adolescents with depressive disorders.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with mixed episodeDepressive symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a depressiveepisode, but in a mixed episode several prominent depressive symptoms occur simultaneously oralternate rapidly with several prominent manic symptoms such as irritability, racing or crowdedthoughts, increased talkativeness or increased activity.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderProblems with attention and concentration in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are persistentover time (i.e. are not episodic) and are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy. However,mood disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses maybe assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.Boundary with prolonged grief disorderProlonged grief disorder is a persistent and pervasive grief response following the death of a partner,parent, child or other person close to the bereaved that persists for an abnormally long period oftime following the loss (e.g. at least 6 months). It is characterized by longing for the deceased orpersistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness,guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self,inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social orother activities). Some common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder are similar to those observedin a depressive episode (e.g. sadness, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, feelings of guilt,suicidal ideation). However, prolonged grief disorder is differentiated from a depressive episodebecause symptoms are circumscribed and specifically focused on the loss of the loved one, whereasdepressive thoughts and emotional reactions typically encompass multiple areas of life. Further,other common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder (e.g. difficulty accepting the loss, difficultytrusting others, feeling bitter or angry about the loss, feeling as though a part of the individual hasdied) are not characteristic of a depressive episode. The timing of the onset of the symptoms inrelation to the loss and whether there is a prior history of a depressive disorder or a bipolar disorderare important to consider in making this distinction.Boundary with dementiaOlder adults experiencing a depressive episode may present with memory difficulties and othercognitive symptoms, which can be severe, and it is important to distinguish these symptomsfrom dementia. Dementia is an acquired chronic condition characterized by significant cognitiveimpairment or decline from a previous level of cognitive functioning in two or more cognitivedomains (e.g. memory, attention, executive function, language, social cognition, psychomotor speed,visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to interfere with performanceor independence in activities of daily living. If memory difficulties and other cognitive symptomsin older adults occur exclusively in the context of a depressive episode, a diagnosis of dementiais generally not appropriate. However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on dementia(e.g. when memory difficulties and other cognitive symptoms substantially predate the onsetMood disorders | Depressive episode 216 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersof the depressive episode). The timing and rate of onset of the memory difficulties and othercognitive symptoms in relation to other depressive symptoms are important to consider in makingthis distinction.Severity and psychotic symptoms specifiersThe severity of all current depressive episodes should be rated based on the number and severity ofthe symptoms, as well as the impact that the mood disturbance has on the individual’s functioning.In addition, moderate and severe depressive episodes are described as without psychoticsymptoms (i.e. delusions or hallucinations) or with psychotic symptoms. By definition, milddepressive episodes do not include psychotic symptoms.Delusions during moderate or severe depressive episodes are commonly persecutory or self-referential (e.g. being pursued by authorities because of imaginary crimes). In addition,delusions of guilt (e.g. falsely blaming oneself for wrongdoing), poverty (e.g. being bankrupt)and impending disaster (perceived to have been brought on by the individual), as well as somatic(e.g. of having contracted some serious disease) or nihilistic delusions (e.g. believing bodyorgans do not exist) are known to occur. Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivityor control (e.g. the experience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are beingplaced in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are beingbroadcast to others) can also occur, but less commonly than in schizophrenia and schizoaffectivedisorder. Auditory hallucinations (e.g. derogatory or accusatory voices that berate the patient forsupposed weaknesses or sins) are more common than visual (e.g. visions of death or destruction)or olfactory hallucinations (e.g. the smell of rotting flesh).Psychotic symptoms are often subtle, and the boundary between psychotic symptoms andpersistent depressive ruminations or sustained preoccupations is not always clear. Psychoticsymptoms may vary in intensity over the course of a depressive episode or even over the courseof the day. Psychotic symptoms may be intentionally concealed by individuals experiencinga depressive episode.Mild depressive episode• None of the symptoms of a depressive episode should be present to an intense degree.• The individual is usually distressed by the symptoms, and has some difficulty in continuingto function in one of more domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupationalor other important domains).• There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Moderate depressive episode without psychotic symptoms• Several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a largenumber of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.• The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains(personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Moderate depressive episode with psychotic symptoms• Several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a largenumber of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.Mood disorders | Depressive episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 217• The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains(personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms• Many or most symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, ora smaller number of symptoms are present and manifest to an intense degree.• The individual has serious difficulty continuing to function in most domains (personal,family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms• Many or most symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, ora smaller number of symptoms are present and manifest to an intense degree.• The individual has serious difficulty continuing to function in most domains (personal,family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).• There are delusions or hallucinations during the episode.Manic episodeEssential (required) features• Both of the following features occur concurrently and persist for most of the day, nearlyevery day, during a period of at least 1 week, unless shortened by a treatment intervention.• An extreme mood state is observable or reported, characterized by euphoria, irritabilityor expansiveness that represents a significant change from the individual’s typical mood.Individuals commonly exhibit rapid changes among different mood states (i.e. moodlability).• Increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy is present, and representsa significant change from the individual’s typical level.• Several of the following symptoms are present, representing a significant change from theindividual’s usual behaviour or subjective state:• increased talkativeness or pressured speech (a feeling of internal pressure to bemore talkative);• flight of ideas or experience of rapid or racing thoughts (e.g. thoughts flow rapidly and,in some cases, illogically from one idea to the next; the person reports that their thoughtsare rapid or even racing and has difficulty remaining on topic);• increased self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g. the individual believes that they can accomplishtasks well beyond their skill level, or that they are about to become famous – in psychoticpresentations of mania, this may be manifested in grandiose delusions);• decreased need for sleep (e.g. the person reports being able to function with only2 or 3 hours of sleep), as distinct from insomnia, in which an individual wants to sleepbut cannot;Mood disorders | Manic episode 218 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• distractibility (e.g. the person cannot stay on task, because attention is drawn to irrelevantor minor environmental stimuli, such as being overly distracted by outside noise duringa conversation);• impulsive reckless behaviour (e.g. the individual impulsively pursues pleasurable activitieswithout regard to their potential for negative consequences, or impulsively makes majordecisions in the absence of adequate planning);• an increase in sexual drive, sociability or goal-directed activity.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. cocaine, amfetamines), including withdrawal effects.• The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.• The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social,educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, requires intensivetreatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, or is accompanied bydelusions or hallucinations.Additional clinical features• Manic episodes may or may not include psychotic symptoms. A wide variety of psychoticsymptoms may occur in mania; among the most common are grandiose delusions (e.g.being chosen by God, having special powers or abilities), persecutory delusions andself-referential delusions (e.g. being conspired against because of one’s special identityor abilities). Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivity or control (e.g. theexperience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’smind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcastto others) may also occur. Hallucinations are less frequent, and commonly accompanydelusions of persecution or reference. They are usually auditory (e.g. adulatory voices), andless commonly visual (e.g. visions of deities), somatic or tactile.• Some patients may exhibit symptoms or impairment in functioning that is sufficientlysevere to require immediate intervention (e.g. treatment with mood-stabilizingmedications). As a result, their symptoms may not meet the full duration requirement ofa manic episode. Episodes that meet the full symptom requirements but last for less than1 week because they are shortened by a treatment intervention should still be consideredmanic episodes.• A manic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should beconsidered a manic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued andthe full diagnostic requirements of a manic episode are met after the direct physiologicaleffects of the treatment are likely to have receded.Mood disorders | Manic episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 219Boundary with normality (threshold)• Periods of euphoric or irritable mood that are entirely contextually appropriate (e.g. euphoriaafter winning a lottery) should not be considered as meeting the mood component of thediagnostic requirements for a manic episode.Developmental presentations• Manic episodes are rare in childhood and adolescence. It is normal for children to displayoverexcitement, exuberance or silliness in contexts such as special occasions, celebrations orsome types of play. A manic episode should only be considered when these behaviours areepisodic and recurrent (or characterized by rapid onset if a first episode), are inappropriatefor the context in which they arise, are in excess of what might be expected given theperson’s age or developmental level, represent a distinct change from previous functioning,and are associated with significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational orother important areas of functioning.• When a manic episode occurs in children or adolescents, all the characteristic features canbe observed. The reports of other informants (e.g. parents) are particularly important in thecase of children in evaluating the nature of symptoms and the extent to which they representa change from previous functioning. The extreme mood state characteristic of a manicepisode may manifest as extreme irritability in children and adolescents. Younger childrenmay exhibit excessive or severe tantrums or increased physical aggression (e.g. throwingthings or hitting).• In children and adolescents, increased distractibility may manifest as a decline in academicperformance, increased time needed to complete school assignments or an inability tocomplete assignments.• Increased self-esteem or grandiosity associated with a manic episode should bedifferentiated from children’s normal tendency to overestimate their abilities and believethat they have special talents. Grandiose beliefs that are held with clear evidence to thecontrary or acted on in such a way that they place the child in danger are more suggestive ofa manic episode. Examples of manifestations of grandiosity include magical or unrealisticideas (e.g. thinking they can fly) in younger children or overestimation of abilities ortalents based on current functioning (e.g. believing they should coach their high schoolsports team) in adolescents.• Specific manifestations of increased goal-directed activities associated with a manicepisode may differ across ages. For example, a younger child might build elaborate projectswith blocks, while an adolescent might disassemble electronics or appliances.• As in adults, children and adolescents may engage in impulsive reckless behaviours duringa manic episode, but these are likely to present differently in children and adolescentsbased on behavioural repertoire and access to specific activities. For example, a child mayexhibit risky play, disregarding possible injury (e.g. running into a busy street, climbing atall tree, trying to fly), whereas for adolescents, analogous behaviour may include drivingfast, spending excessively or engaging in risky sexual behaviour.Mood disorders | Manic episode 220 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with hypomanic episodeThe symptoms of manic episodes may be qualitatively similar to those of hypomanic episodes but,unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to result in significantimpairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas offunctioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others,or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.Boundary with mixed episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a manic episode, but ina mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly withseveral prominent depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness,hopelessness or suicidal ideation.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderMany features of a manic episode – such as increased activity, rapid speech and over-talkativeness,distractibility and impulsivity – can be observed in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. Differentiating between these disorders can be particularly challenging among childrenand adolescents. However, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, symptoms have their onsetbefore the age of 12 years, are persistent over time (i.e. are not episodic), and are not temporallytied to changes in mood or energy (e.g. are not accompanied by intense mood elevation). However,rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are substantially elevated compared to the generalpopulation among children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorders, and both diagnosesmay be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.Mixed episodeEssential (required) features• Several prominent manic and several prominent depressive symptoms consistent withthose observed in manic episodes and depressive episodes are present, which eitheroccur simultaneously or alternate very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day).Symptoms must include an altered mood state consistent with a manic and/or depressiveepisode (i.e. depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive mood), and be present mostof the day, nearly every day, during a period of at least 2 weeks, unless shortened by atreatment intervention.• When manic symptoms predominate in a mixed episode, common depressive (contrapolar)symptoms are dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, hopelessness andsuicidal ideation.• When depressive symptoms predominate in a mixed episode, common manic (contrapolar)symptoms are irritability, racing or crowded thoughts, increased talkativeness andincreased activity.Mood disorders | Mixed episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 221• When depressive and manic symptoms alternate rapidly during a mixed episode, suchfluctuations may be observed in mood (e.g. between euphoria and sadness or dysphoria),emotional reactivity (e.g. between flat affect and intense or exaggerated reactiveness toemotional stimuli), drive (e.g. alternating periods of increased and decreased activity,verbal expression, sexual desire or appetite) and cognitive functioning (e.g. periods ofactivation and inhibition or slowing of thoughts, attention and memory).• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from cocaine).• The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social,educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, or is accompanied bydelusions or hallucinations.Additional clinical features• Delusions and hallucinations characteristic of both depressive and manic episodes (seeabove) can occur in mixed episodes.• A mixed syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should beconsidered a mixed episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued andthe full diagnostic requirements of a mixed episode are met after the direct physiologicaleffects of the treatment are likely to have receded.Developmental presentations• Research regarding mixed episodes in children and adolescents is limited; however, someevidence suggests that adolescents with bipolar disorders may be more likely than adultswith bipolar disorders to experience mixed episodes.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with manic episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a manic episode, butin a mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidlywith several depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness,hopelessness or suicidal ideation.Mood disorders | Mixed episode 222 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with depressive episodeDepressive symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a depressiveepisode, but in a mixed episode several prominent depressive symptoms occur simultaneously oralternate rapidly with several prominent manic symptoms such as irritability, racing or crowdedthoughts, increased talkativeness or increased activity.Boundary with hypomanic episodeManic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a hypomanic episodebut, unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance in a mixed episode is sufficiently severeto result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to preventharm to self or others, or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.

This does not include periodsof elevated or irritable mood that are contextually appropriate (e.g. elevated mood aftergraduating from school or related to falling in love). Rapid shifts among different moodstates commonly occur (i.e. mood lability).• Increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy is present, and representsa significant change from the individual’s typical level.• In addition, several of the following symptoms are present, representing a significantchange from the individual’s usual behaviour (e.g. the change would be apparent to otherswho know the individual well) or subjective state:• increased talkativeness or pressured speech (a feeling of internal pressure to be moretalkative);• flight of ideas or experience of rapid or racing thoughts (e.g. thoughts flow rapidly fromone idea to the next; the person reports that their thoughts are rapid or even racing andhas difficulty remaining on a topic);• increased self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g. the individual is more self-confident than usual);• decreased need for sleep (e.g. the person reports needing less sleep than usual and still feelswell-rested), as distinct from insomnia, in which an individual wants to sleep but cannot;• distractibility (e.g. the person has difficulty staying on task, because attention is drawnto irrelevant or minor environmental stimuli, such as being overly distracted by outsidenoise during a conversation);Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode MMoooodd ddiissoorrddeerrss 223• impulsive reckless behaviour (e.g. the individual pursues pleasurable activities with littleregard to their potential for negative consequences, or makes decisions in the absenceof adequate planning);• an increase in sexual drive, sociability or goal-directed activity.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. cocaine, amfetamines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).• The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.• The mood disturbance is not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment inoccupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others, and isnot accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.Additional clinical features• A hypomanic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (medication,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) shouldbe considered a hypomanic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment isdiscontinued and the full diagnostic requirements of a hypomanic episode are met afterthe direct physiological effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Hypomanic episodes are often difficult to distinguish from normal periods of elevatedmood – for example, related to positive life events – particularly given that hypomanicepisodes are not associated with significant functional impairment. In order to beconsidered a hypomanic episode, the symptoms must represent a significant and noticeablechange from the individual’s typical mood and behaviour.• The occurrence of one or more hypomanic episodes in the absence of a history of othertypes of mood episodes (manic, depressive or mixed episodes) is not a sufficient basis fora diagnosis of a mood disorder.Developmental presentations• As in adults, hypomanic episodes in children and adolescents are similar to – but less severethan – manic episodes, and may present for a shorter period of time. The informationin the section on developmental presentations for manic episode, above, is therefore alsoapplicable to hypomanic episode.Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode 224 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Hypomanic episodes may be difficult to distinguish from developmentally normativebehaviours in children and adolescents (e.g. changes in sleep or irritability duringadolescence).

121,6B00,Generalised anxiety disorder,"Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by marked symptoms of anxiety that persist for at least several months, for more days than not, manifested by either general apprehension (i.e. ‘free-floating anxiety’) or excessive worry focused on multiple everyday events, most often concerning family, health, finances, and school or work, together with additional symptoms such as muscular tension or motor restlessness, sympathetic autonomic over-activity, subjective experience of nervousness, difficulty maintaining concentration, irritability, or sleep disturbance. The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another health condition and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system.",,,"Generalized anxiety disorderEssential (required) features• Marked symptoms of anxiety are required for diagnosis, manifested in either:• general apprehensiveness that is not restricted to any particular environmentalcircumstance (i.e. free-floating anxiety); or• excessive worry (apprehensive expectation) about negative events occurring in severaldifferent aspects of everyday life (e.g. work, finances, health, family).• Anxiety and general apprehensiveness or worry are accompanied by additionalcharacteristic symptoms, such as:• muscle tension or motor restlessness;• sympathetic autonomic overactivity as evidenced by frequent gastrointestinal symptomssuch as nausea and/or abdominal distress, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shakingand/or dry mouth;• subjective experience of nervousness, restlessness or being on edge;• difficulty concentrating;• irritability;• sleep disturbances (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).• The symptoms are not transient and persist for at least several months, for more daysthan not.• The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a depressivedisorder).• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hyperthyroidism),and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system(e.g. caffeine, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepines).• The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptomsor significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significantadditional effort.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 267Additional clinical features• Some individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may only report generalapprehensiveness accompanied by chronic somatic symptoms without being able toarticulate specific worry content.• Behavioural changes such as avoidance, frequent need for reassurance (especially inchildren) and procrastination may be seen. These behaviours typically represent an effortto reduce apprehension or prevent untoward events from occurring.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Anxiety and worry are normal emotional/cognitive states that commonly occur whenpeople are under stress. At optimal levels, anxiety and worry may help to direct problem-solving efforts, focus attention adaptively and increase alertness. Normal anxiety and worryare usually sufficiently self-regulated that they do not interfere with functioning or causemarked distress. In generalized anxiety disorder, the anxiety or worry is excessive, persistentand intense, and may have a significant negative impact on functioning. Individuals underextremely stressful circumstances (e.g. living in a war zone) may experience intense andimpairing anxiety and worry that is appropriate to their environmental circumstances.These experiences should not be regarded as symptomatic of generalized anxiety disorderif they occur only under such circumstances.Course features• Onset of generalized anxiety disorder may occur at any age. However, the typical age ofonset is during the early to mid-30s.• Earlier onset of symptoms is associated with greater impairment of functioning andpresence of co-occurring mental disorders.• Severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms often fluctuates between threshold andsubthreshold forms of the disorder, and full remission of symptoms is uncommon.• Although the clinical features of generalized anxiety disorder generally remain consistentacross the lifespan, the content of the individual’s worry may vary over time, and there aredifferences in worry content among different age groups. Children and adolescents tend toworry about the quality of academic and sports-related performance, whereas adults tendto worry more about their own well-being or that of their loved ones.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder 268 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersDevelopmental presentations• Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhoodand adolescence. Among these disorders, generalized anxiety disorder is one of the mostcommon in late childhood and adolescence.• Occurrence of generalized anxiety disorder increases across late childhood and adolescencewith development of cognitive abilities that support the capacity for worry, which is a corefeature of the disorder. As a result of their less developed cognitive abilities, generalizedanxiety disorder is uncommon in children younger than 5 years.• While the essential features of generalized anxiety disorder still apply to children andadolescents, specific manifestations of worry in children may include being overlyconcerned and compliant with rules, as well as a strong desire to please others. Affectedchildren may become upset when they perceive peers as acting out or being disobedient.Consequently, children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may be morelikely to report excessively on their peers’ misbehaviour or to act as an authority figurearound peers, condemning misbehaviour. This may have a negative effect on affectedindividuals’ interpersonal relationships.• Children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may engage in excessivereassurance-seeking from others, asking questions repeatedly, and may exhibit distresswhen faced with uncertainty. They may be overly perfectionistic, taking additional timeto complete tasks such as homework or classwork. Sensitivity to perceived criticism iscommon.• When generalized anxiety disorder does occur in children, somatic symptoms – particularlythose related to sympathetic autonomic overactivity – may be prominent aspects of theclinical presentation. Common somatic symptoms in children with generalized anxietydisorder include frequent headaches, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal distress. As withadults, children and adolescents also experience sleep disturbances, including delayedsleep onset and night-time wakefulness.• The number and content of worries typically manifests differently across childhood andadolescence. Younger children are more like to have more concerns about their safety, theirhealth or the health of others. Adolescents typically report a greater number of worries,with content shifting to performance, perfectionism and whether they will be able to meetthe expectations of others.• Adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may demonstrate excessive irritability andhave an increased risk of co-occurring depressive symptoms.Culture-related features• For many cultural groups, somatic complaints rather than excessive worry may predominatein the clinical presentation. These symptoms may involve a range of physical complaintsnot typically associated with generalized anxiety disorder, such as dizziness and heat inthe head.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 269• Realistic worries may be misjudged as excessive without appropriate contextualinformation. For example, migrant workers may worry greatly about being deported, butthis may be related to actual deportation threats by their employer. On the other hand,evidence of worries across several different aspects of everyday life may be difficult toestablish when an individual places emphasis on a single overwhelming source of worry(e.g. financial concerns).• Worry content may vary by cultural group, related to topics that are salient in the milieu.For example, in societies where relationships with deceased relatives are important, worrymay focus on their spiritual status in the afterlife. Worry in more individualistic culturesmay emphasize personal achievement, fulfilment of expectations or self-confidence.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is approximately twice as high amongwomen.• Among individuals with onset of generalized anxiety disorder during childhood oradolescence, girls are likely to have earlier symptom onset.• Although symptom presentation does not vary by gender – including the common co-occurrence of generalized anxiety disorder and depressive disorders – men are more likelyto experience co-occurring disorders due to substance use.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions(differential diagnosis)Boundary with panic disorderPanic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited episodes of intense fear oranxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder is differentiated by a more persistent and less circumscribedchronic feeling of apprehensiveness, usually associated with worry about a variety of differenteveryday life events. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may experience panicattacks that are triggered by specific worries. If an individual with generalized anxiety disorderexperiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of the worry about a variety of everydaylife events, or general apprehensiveness without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, anadditional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted and the presence of panic attacks may beindicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur,an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIn social anxiety disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g. speakingin public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negativelyevaluated by others. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry about theimplications of performing poorly or failing an examination but are not exclusively concernedabout being negatively evaluated by others.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder 270 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersassociated with pessimistic thoughts. Depressive disorders are differentiated by the presenceof low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, and by other characteristicsymptoms of depressive disorders (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, suicidalideation). Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with depressive disorders, but should onlybe diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior tothe onset of or following complete remission of a depressive episode.Boundary with adjustment disorderAdjustment disorder involves maladaptive reactions to an identifiable psychosocial stressor ormultiple stressors characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences. Reactionsmay include excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constantrumination about its implications. Adjustment disorder centres on the identifiable stressor orits consequences, whereas in generalized anxiety disorder, worry typically encompasses multipleareas of daily life and may include hypothetical concerns (e.g. that a negative life event may occur).Unlike individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, those with adjustment disorder typicallyhave normal functioning prior to the onset of the stressors. Symptoms of adjustment disordergenerally resolve within 6 months.Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderIn obsessive-compulsive disorder, the focus of apprehension is on intrusive and unwantedthoughts, urges or images (obsessions), whereas in generalized anxiety disorder the focus ison everyday life events. In contrast to obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, which areusually experienced as unwanted and intrusive, individuals with generalized anxiety disordermay experience their worry as a helpful strategy in averting negative outcomes.Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder) and bodily distressdisorderIn hypochondriasis and bodily distress disorder, individuals worry about real or perceived physicalsymptoms and their potential significance to their health status. Individuals with generalizedanxiety disorder experience somatic symptoms associated with anxiety and may worry abouttheir health, but their worry extends to other aspects of everyday life.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorderIndividuals with post-traumatic stress disorder develop hypervigilance as a consequence ofexposure to the traumatic stressor, and may become apprehensive that they or others close tothem may be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. Individualswith post-traumatic stress disorder may also experience anxiety triggered by reminders of thetraumatic event (e.g. fear and avoidance of a place where an individual was assaulted). In contrast,the anxiety and worry in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder is directed towards thepossibility of untoward events in a variety of life domains (e.g. health, finances, work).Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 271",Generalised anxiety disorder,"Disorder Name: Generalised anxiety disorderDisorder Code: 6B00Disorder symptoms: Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by marked symptoms of anxiety that persist for at least several months, for more days than not, manifested by either general apprehension (i.e. ‘free-floating anxiety’) or excessive worry focused on multiple everyday events, most often concerning family, health, finances, and school or work, together with additional symptoms such as muscular tension or motor restlessness, sympathetic autonomic over-activity, subjective experience of nervousness, difficulty maintaining concentration, irritability, or sleep disturbance.

As a result of their less developed cognitive abilities, generalizedanxiety disorder is uncommon in children younger than 5 years.• While the essential features of generalized anxiety disorder still apply to children andadolescents, specific manifestations of worry in children may include being overlyconcerned and compliant with rules, as well as a strong desire to please others. Affectedchildren may become upset when they perceive peers as acting out or being disobedient.Consequently, children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may be morelikely to report excessively on their peers’ misbehaviour or to act as an authority figurearound peers, condemning misbehaviour. This may have a negative effect on affectedindividuals’ interpersonal relationships.• Children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may engage in excessivereassurance-seeking from others, asking questions repeatedly, and may exhibit distresswhen faced with uncertainty. They may be overly perfectionistic, taking additional timeto complete tasks such as homework or classwork. Sensitivity to perceived criticism iscommon.• When generalized anxiety disorder does occur in children, somatic symptoms – particularlythose related to sympathetic autonomic overactivity – may be prominent aspects of theclinical presentation. Common somatic symptoms in children with generalized anxietydisorder include frequent headaches, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal distress. As withadults, children and adolescents also experience sleep disturbances, including delayedsleep onset and night-time wakefulness.• The number and content of worries typically manifests differently across childhood andadolescence. Younger children are more like to have more concerns about their safety, theirhealth or the health of others. Adolescents typically report a greater number of worries,with content shifting to performance, perfectionism and whether they will be able to meetthe expectations of others.• Adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may demonstrate excessive irritability andhave an increased risk of co-occurring depressive symptoms.Culture-related features• For many cultural groups, somatic complaints rather than excessive worry may predominatein the clinical presentation. These symptoms may involve a range of physical complaintsnot typically associated with generalized anxiety disorder, such as dizziness and heat inthe head.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 269• Realistic worries may be misjudged as excessive without appropriate contextualinformation. For example, migrant workers may worry greatly about being deported, butthis may be related to actual deportation threats by their employer. On the other hand,evidence of worries across several different aspects of everyday life may be difficult toestablish when an individual places emphasis on a single overwhelming source of worry(e.g. financial concerns).• Worry content may vary by cultural group, related to topics that are salient in the milieu.For example, in societies where relationships with deceased relatives are important, worrymay focus on their spiritual status in the afterlife. Worry in more individualistic culturesmay emphasize personal achievement, fulfilment of expectations or self-confidence.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is approximately twice as high amongwomen.• Among individuals with onset of generalized anxiety disorder during childhood oradolescence, girls are likely to have earlier symptom onset.• Although symptom presentation does not vary by gender – including the common co-occurrence of generalized anxiety disorder and depressive disorders – men are more likelyto experience co-occurring disorders due to substance use.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions(differential diagnosis)Boundary with panic disorderPanic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited episodes of intense fear oranxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder is differentiated by a more persistent and less circumscribedchronic feeling of apprehensiveness, usually associated with worry about a variety of differenteveryday life events. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may experience panicattacks that are triggered by specific worries. If an individual with generalized anxiety disorderexperiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of the worry about a variety of everydaylife events, or general apprehensiveness without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, anadditional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted and the presence of panic attacks may beindicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur,an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIn social anxiety disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g. speakingin public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negativelyevaluated by others. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry about theimplications of performing poorly or failing an examination but are not exclusively concernedabout being negatively evaluated by others.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder 270 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersassociated with pessimistic thoughts. Depressive disorders are differentiated by the presenceof low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, and by other characteristicsymptoms of depressive disorders (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, suicidalideation). Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with depressive disorders, but should onlybe diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior tothe onset of or following complete remission of a depressive episode.Boundary with adjustment disorderAdjustment disorder involves maladaptive reactions to an identifiable psychosocial stressor ormultiple stressors characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences. Reactionsmay include excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constantrumination about its implications. Adjustment disorder centres on the identifiable stressor orits consequences, whereas in generalized anxiety disorder, worry typically encompasses multipleareas of daily life and may include hypothetical concerns (e.g. that a negative life event may occur).Unlike individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, those with adjustment disorder typicallyhave normal functioning prior to the onset of the stressors. Symptoms of adjustment disordergenerally resolve within 6 months.Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderIn obsessive-compulsive disorder, the focus of apprehension is on intrusive and unwantedthoughts, urges or images (obsessions), whereas in generalized anxiety disorder the focus ison everyday life events. In contrast to obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, which areusually experienced as unwanted and intrusive, individuals with generalized anxiety disordermay experience their worry as a helpful strategy in averting negative outcomes.Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder) and bodily distressdisorderIn hypochondriasis and bodily distress disorder, individuals worry about real or perceived physicalsymptoms and their potential significance to their health status. Individuals with generalizedanxiety disorder experience somatic symptoms associated with anxiety and may worry abouttheir health, but their worry extends to other aspects of everyday life.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorderIndividuals with post-traumatic stress disorder develop hypervigilance as a consequence ofexposure to the traumatic stressor, and may become apprehensive that they or others close tothem may be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. Individualswith post-traumatic stress disorder may also experience anxiety triggered by reminders of thetraumatic event (e.g. fear and avoidance of a place where an individual was assaulted). In contrast,the anxiety and worry in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder is directed towards thepossibility of untoward events in a variety of life domains (e.g. health, finances, work).Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 271"
122,6B01,Panic disorder,"Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks that are not restricted to particular stimuli or situations. Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension accompanied by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms (e.g. palpitations or increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, chills, hot flushes, fear of imminent death). In addition, panic disorder is characterised by persistent concern about the recurrence or significance of panic attacks, or behaviours intended to avoid their recurrence, that results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system.",,Panic attack,"Panic disorderEssential (required) features• Recurrent panic attacks, which are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehensioncharacterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms, arerequired for diagnosis. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, the following:• palpitations or increased heart rate• sweating• trembling• sensations of shortness of breath• feelings of choking• chest pain• nausea or abdominal distress• feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness• chills or hot flushes• tingling or lack of sensation in extremities (i.e. paraesthesias)• depersonalization or derealization• fear of losing control or going mad• fear of imminent death.• At least some of the panic attacks are unexpected – that is, they are not restricted toparticular stimuli or situations but rather seem to arise out of the blue.• Panic attacks are followed by persistent concern or worry (e.g. for several weeks) abouttheir recurrence or their perceived negative significance (e.g. that the physiologicalsymptoms may be those of a myocardial infarction), or by behaviours intended to avoidtheir recurrence (e.g. only leaving the home with a trusted companion).• Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety-provoking situations in the context of anothermental disorder.• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g.pheochromocytoma), and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication onthe central nervous system (e.g. coffee, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol,benzodiazepines).• The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it isonly through significant additional effort.Note: panic attacks can occur in other anxiety and fear-related disorders and in other mentaldisorders; therefore, the presence of panic attacks is not in itself sufficient to assign a diagnosis ofpanic disorder.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder 272 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• Individual panic attacks usually only last for minutes, though some may last longer. Thefrequency and severity of panic attacks varies widely (e.g. many times per day to a fewtimes per month) within and across individuals.• In panic disorder, it is common for panic attacks to become more expected over timeas they become associated with particular stimuli or contexts, which may originally havebeen coincidental. (For example, an individual who has an unexpected panic attack whencrossing a bridge may subsequently become anxious when crossing bridges, which couldthen lead to expected panic attacks in response to bridges.)• Limited-symptom attacks (i.e. attacks that are similar to panic attacks, except that theyare accompanied by only a few symptoms characteristic of a panic attack without thecharacteristic intense peak of symptoms) are common in individuals with panic disorder,particularly as behavioural strategies (e.g. avoidance) are used to curtail anxiety symptoms.However, in order to qualify for a diagnosis of panic disorder, there must be a history ofrecurrent panic attacks that meet the full diagnostic requirements.• Some individuals with panic disorder experience nocturnal panic attacks – that is, wakingfrom sleep in a state of panic.• Although the pattern of symptoms (e.g. mainly respiratory, nocturnal), the severity of theanxiety and the extent of avoidance behaviours are variable, panic disorder is one of themost impairing of the anxiety disorders. Individuals often present repeatedly for emergencycare, and may undergo a range of unnecessary and costly special medical investigationsdespite repeated negative findings.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Panic attacks are common in the general population, particularly in response to anxiety-provoking life events. Panic attacks in response to real threats to an individual’s physical orpsychological integrity are considered part of the normative continuum of reactions, and adiagnosis is not warranted in such cases. Panic disorder is differentiated from normal fearreactions by frequent recurrence of panic attacks, persistent worry or concern about thepanic attacks or their meaning, or alterations in behaviour (e.g. avoidance) and associatedsignificant impairment in functioning.• The sudden onset, rapid peaking, unexpected nature and intense severity of panic attacksdifferentiate them from normal situationally bound anxiety that may be experienced ineveryday life (e.g. during stressful life transitions such as moving to a new city).Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 273Course features• Onset of panic disorder typically occurs during the early 20s.• Some individuals experience episodic symptom outbreaks with long periods of remission,while others experience persistent, severe symptoms.• The presence of co-occurring disorders (e.g. other anxiety and fear-related disorders,depressive disorders, disorders due to substance use) has been associated with poorerlong-term course trajectory.• A co-occurring diagnosis of agoraphobia is generally associated with greater symptomseverity and a poorer long-term prognosis.Developmental presentations• Although some children report physical symptoms of panic attacks, panic disorder isvery rare in younger children because cognitive capacity for catastrophizing about thesignificance of symptoms is not yet fully developed. The prevalence of panic disorderincreases across adolescence and early adulthood.• Adolescents with panic disorder are at greater risk of a co-occurring depressive disorderincluding suicidality, as well as of disorders due to substance use.Culture-related features• The symptom presentation of panic attacks may vary across cultures, influenced by culturalattributions about their etiology. For example, individuals of Cambodian origin mayemphasize panic symptoms attributed to dysregulation of khyâl, a wind-like substance intraditional Cambodian ethnophysiology (e.g. dizziness, tinnitus, neck soreness).• Several notable cultural concepts of distress are related to panic disorder; these link panic,fear or anxiety to etiological attributions regarding specific social and environmentalinfluences. Examples include attributions related to interpersonal conflict (e.g. ataquede nervios among Latin American people), exertion or orthostasis (khyâl cap amongCambodians), and atmospheric wind (trúng gió among Vietnamese individuals). Thesecultural labels may be applied to symptom presentations other than panic (e.g. angerparoxysms, in the case of ataque de nervios), but they often constitute panic episodes orpresentations with partial phenomenological overlap with panic attacks.• Clarifying cultural attributions and the context of the experience of symptoms can informwhether panic attacks should be considered unexpected, as must be the case in panicdisorder. For example, panic attacks may involve specific foci of apprehension that arebetter accounted for by another disorder (e.g. social situations in social anxiety disorder).Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder 274 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersMoreover, the cultural linkage of the apprehension focus with specific exposures (e.g. windor cold and trúng gió panic attacks) may suggest that acute anxiety is expected whenconsidered within the individual’s cultural framework.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Panic disorder is twice as prevalent among females as males, with gender differences inprevalence rates beginning during puberty.• Gender differences in clinical features or symptom presentation have not been observed.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with generalized anxiety disorderSome individuals with panic disorder may experience anxiety and worry between panic attacks.If the focus of the anxiety and worry is confined to fear of having a panic attack or the possibleimplications of panic attacks (e.g. that the individual may be suffering from a cardiovascularillness), an additional diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder is not warranted. If, however, theindividual is more generally anxious about a number of life events in addition to experiencingunexpected panic attacks, an additional diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder may beappropriate.Boundary with agoraphobiaDuring the early phase of panic disorder, panic attacks are often perceived as completelyunpredictable or out of the blue. However, over time, as panic attacks occur in specific situations,those situations become associated with the experience of intense anxiety. As a consequence, theindividual may develop anticipatory anxiety about being in those situations, or exposure to thosesituations may actually trigger panic attacks. In this way, it is common for individuals with panicdisorder to develop some degree of agoraphobic symptoms over time. If the individual developsfears that panic attacks or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms will occur in multiplesituations, and as a result actively avoids these situations, requires the presence of a companion,or endures them only with intense fear or anxiety and all other diagnostic requirements foragoraphobia are met, an additional diagnosis of agoraphobia may be assigned.Boundary with depressive disordersPanic attacks can occur in depressive disorders – particularly in those with prominent anxietysymptoms, including mixed depressive and anxiety disorder – and may be triggered by depressiveruminations. If unexpected panic attacks occur in the context of these disorders and the mainconcern is about recurrence of panic attacks or the significance of panic symptoms, an additionaldiagnosis of panic disorder may be appropriate.Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)Individuals with hypochondriasis often misinterpret bodily symptoms as evidence that theymay have one or more life-threatening illnesses. Although individuals with panic disorder mayAnxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 275also manifest concerns that physical manifestations of anxiety are indicative of life-threateningillnesses (e.g. myocardial infarction), these symptoms typically occur in the midst of a panic attack.Individuals with panic disorder are more concerned about the recurrence of panic attacks or thesignificance of panic symptoms, are less likely to report somatic concerns attributable to bodilysymptoms other than those associated with anxiety, and are less likely to engage in repetitiveand excessive health-related behaviours. However, panic attacks can occur in hypochondriasis,and if they are exclusively associated with fears of having a life-threatening illness, an additionaldiagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted. In this situation, the with panic attacks specifier canbe applied to the diagnosis of hypochondriasis. If there are persistent and repetitive panic attacksin the context of hypochondriasis that are unexpected in the sense that they are not in responseto illness-related concerns, both diagnoses should be assigned.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIrritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with panic disorder in childrenand adolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when presented with a taskor situations that make them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to leave the home without a trustedcompanion such as a parent or caregiver). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggeredby a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiantdisorder is generally not appropriate.Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disordersPanic attacks can occur in the context of a variety of other mental disorders – particularly otheranxiety and fear-related disorders, disorders specifically associated with stress, and obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. When panic attacks occur in the context of these disorders, theyare generally part of an intense anxiety response to a distressing internal or external stimulus thatrepresents a focus of apprehension in that disorder (e.g. a particular object or situation in specificphobia, fear of negative social evaluation in social anxiety disorder, fear of being contaminatedby germs in obsessive-compulsive disorder, fear of having a serious illness in hypochondriasis,reminders of a traumatic event in post-traumatic stress disorder). If panic attacks are limited tosuch situations in the context of another disorder, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder is notwarranted.

123,6B02,Agoraphobia,"Agoraphobia is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in response to multiple situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available, such as using public transportation, being in crowds, being outside the home alone (e.g., in shops, theatres, standing in line). The individual is consistently anxious about these situations due to a fear of specific negative outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, other incapacitating or embarrassing physical symptoms). The situations are actively avoided, entered only under specific circumstances such as in the presence of a trusted companion, or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The symptoms persist for at least several months, and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.",,,"AgoraphobiaEssential (required) features• Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in, or in anticipation of, multiple situationswhere escape might be difficult or help might not be available is required for diagnosis.Examples include using public transportation, or being in crowds, outside the home alone,in shops or theatres, or standing in line.• The individual is consistently fearful or anxious about these situations due to a fear ofspecific negative outcomes such as panic attacks, symptoms of panic, or other incapacitating(e.g. falling) or embarrassing physical symptoms (e.g. incontinence).Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia 276 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• The situations are actively avoided, are entered only under specific circumstances (e.g. inthe presence of a companion), or else are endured with intense fear or anxiety.• The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g.at least several months).• The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. paranoidideation in delusional disorder, social withdrawal in depressive disorders).• The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptomsor significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significantadditional effort.Additional clinical features• The experiences feared by individuals with agoraphobia may include symptoms of a panicattack as described in panic disorder (e.g. palpitations or increased heart rate, chest pain,feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness) or other symptoms that may be incapacitating,frightening, difficult to manage or embarrassing (e.g. incontinence, changes in vision,vomiting). It is often important to establish quite specifically the nature of the fearedoutcome in agoraphobia, as this may inform the specific choice of treatment strategies.• It is common for individuals with agoraphobia to have a history of panic attacks, althoughthey may not currently meet the diagnostic requirements for panic disorder, or indeedmay not have panic attacks at all because they avoid situations in which panic attacksmay occur. Establishing that an individual’s focus of apprehension relates specifically toexperiencing the bodily symptoms of a panic attack is important in considering whether toadd components of panic disorder treatment (e.g. interoceptive exposure) to the treatmentof agoraphobia, even when there is no current panic disorder diagnosis.• Individuals with agoraphobia may employ a variety of different behavioural strategies ifrequired to enter feared situations. One such safety behaviour is to require the presenceof a companion. Other strategies may include going to certain places only at particulartimes of day, or carrying specific materials (e.g. medications, towels) in case of the fearednegative outcome. These strategies may change over the course of the disorder and fromone occasion to the next. For example, on different occasions in the same situation anindividual may insist on having a companion, endure the situation with distress, or usevarious safety behaviours to cope with their anxiety.• Although the pattern of symptoms, the severity of the anxiety and the extent of avoidanceare variable, agoraphobia is one of the most impairing of the anxiety and fear-relateddisorders to the extent that some individuals become completely housebound; this has animpact on opportunities for employment, seeking medical care and the ability to form andmaintain relationships.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia Anxiety and fear-related disorders 277Boundary with normality (threshold)• Individuals may exhibit transient avoidance behaviours in the context of normaldevelopment or in periods of increased stress. These behaviours are differentiated fromagoraphobia because they are limited in duration and do not lead to significant impact onfunctioning.• Individuals with disabilities or medical conditions may avoid certain situations becauseof reasonable concerns about being incapacitated or embarrassed (e.g. a person with amobility limitation who is concerned that an unfamiliar location will not be accessible,a person with Crohn disease who is concerned about experiencing sudden diarrhoea).Agoraphobia should only be diagnosed if the anxiety and avoidance result in functionalimpairment that is greater than expected given the disability or health condition.Course features• The typical age of onset for agoraphobia is in late adolescence, with the majority ofindividuals experiencing onset before 35 years of age. However, age of onset is later (duringthe mid- to late 20s) for individuals without a history of panic attacks or pre-existingdiagnosis of panic disorder. Onset during childhood is considered rare.• Agoraphobia is generally considered a chronic and persistent condition. The long-termcourse and outcome of agoraphobia is associated with increased risk of developingdepressive disorders, dysthymic disorder and disorders due to substance use.• Greater symptom severity (e.g. avoidance of most activities, being housebound) isassociated with higher rates of relapse and chronicity, and a poorer long-term prognosis.• The presence of co-occurring disorders – particularly other anxiety and fear-relateddisorders, depressive disorders, personality disorder and disorders due to substance use –has been associated with a poorer long-term prognosis.Developmental presentations• Although the clinical features of agoraphobia generally remain consistent across thelifespan, specific triggers and related cognitions can vary across age groups. For example,whereas fear of being outside the home alone or becoming lost are common duringchildhood, adults are more likely to fear standing in line, being in crowded or open spaces,or experiencing a panic attack. Among older adults, fear of falling is common.• As with adults, children and adolescents with agoraphobia may demonstrate excessiveavoidance of certain situations or locations, or require the presence of a close friend or familymember to enter these situations. Children with agoraphobia are likely to resist leaving theAnxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia 278 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordershome without a parent or caregiver. A common focus of apprehension is becoming lostand not being able to obtain help. Soliciting information from collateral informants whoknow the child well can assist in clarifying the child’s focus of apprehension.Culture-related features• Assessment of agoraphobia should incorporate information on cultural and gender norms.For example, fear of leaving the home among populations and contexts in which violenceis common should not be assigned this diagnosis unless the fear is in excess of what isculturally normative. Likewise, for individuals in cultures who spend most of their timeat home, anxiety when in open areas (e.g. markets) may be expected; the disorder shouldonly be diagnosed when the fear exceeds cultural norms.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Lifetime prevalence of agoraphobia is approximately twice as high among women. Amongchildren, it is more frequently reported in girls, with symptom onset occurring earlier forgirls than boys.• Men with agoraphobia are more likely to report co-occurring disorders due to substance use.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with panic disorderIt is common for individuals with panic disorder to develop some degree of agoraphobicsymptoms over time. If the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks that arenot restricted to particular stimuli or situations, and agoraphobic symptoms do not meet thefull diagnostic requirements for agoraphobia, then panic disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.Conversely, many individuals with agoraphobia have experienced recurrent panic attacks. If anindividual with agoraphobia experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of the multipleagoraphobic situations without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, an additional diagnosisof panic disorder is not warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated usingthe with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additionaldiagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.Boundary with specific phobiaSpecific phobia is differentiated from agoraphobia because it involves fear of circumscribedsituations or stimuli themselves (e.g. heights, animals, blood or injury) rather than fear or anxietyof imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitationAnxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia Anxiety and fear-related disorders 279or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations whereobtaining help or escaping might be difficult.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIn social anxiety disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g. speakingin public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negativelyevaluated by others.Boundary with separation anxiety disorderAs with agoraphobia, individuals with separation anxiety disorder avoid situations but, incontrast, they do so to prevent or limit being away from individuals to whom they are attached(e.g. parent, spouse, or child) for fear of losing them.Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disordersIndividuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may avoid situations asa consequence of persecutory or paranoid delusions rather than because of fear or anxiety ofimminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation,or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations whereobtaining help or escaping might be difficult.Boundary with depressive disordersIn depressive disorders, individuals may avoid multiple situations, but do so because of loss ofinterest in previously pleasurable activities or due to lack of energy rather than because of fearor anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic,incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiplesituations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder, the individual deliberately avoids reminders likely to producere-experiencing of the traumatic event. In contrast, situations are avoided in agoraphobia becauseof fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptomsof panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur inmultiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIrritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children andadolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to enter situationsthat make them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to leave the home without a trusted companionsuch as a parent or caregiver). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggered by a situationor stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder isgenerally not appropriate.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia 280 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders",Agoraphobia,"Disorder Name: AgoraphobiaDisorder Code: 6B02Disorder symptoms: Agoraphobia is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in response to multiple situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available, such as using public transportation, being in crowds, being outside the home alone (e.g., in shops, theatres, standing in line). The individual is consistently anxious about these situations due to a fear of specific negative outcomes (e.g., panic attacks, other incapacitating or embarrassing physical symptoms). The situations are actively avoided, entered only under specific circumstances such as in the presence of a trusted companion, or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The symptoms persist for at least several months, and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.AgoraphobiaEssential (required) features• Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in, or in anticipation of, multiple situationswhere escape might be difficult or help might not be available is required for diagnosis.Examples include using public transportation, or being in crowds, outside the home alone,in shops or theatres, or standing in line.• The individual is consistently fearful or anxious about these situations due to a fear ofspecific negative outcomes such as panic attacks, symptoms of panic, or other incapacitating(e.g. falling) or embarrassing physical symptoms (e.g. incontinence).Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia 276 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• The situations are actively avoided, are entered only under specific circumstances (e.g. inthe presence of a companion), or else are endured with intense fear or anxiety.• The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g.at least several months).• The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. paranoidideation in delusional disorder, social withdrawal in depressive disorders).• The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptomsor significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significantadditional effort.Additional clinical features• The experiences feared by individuals with agoraphobia may include symptoms of a panicattack as described in panic disorder (e.g. palpitations or increased heart rate, chest pain,feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness) or other symptoms that may be incapacitating,frightening, difficult to manage or embarrassing (e.g. incontinence, changes in vision,vomiting). It is often important to establish quite specifically the nature of the fearedoutcome in agoraphobia, as this may inform the specific choice of treatment strategies.• It is common for individuals with agoraphobia to have a history of panic attacks, althoughthey may not currently meet the diagnostic requirements for panic disorder, or indeedmay not have panic attacks at all because they avoid situations in which panic attacksmay occur. Establishing that an individual’s focus of apprehension relates specifically toexperiencing the bodily symptoms of a panic attack is important in considering whether toadd components of panic disorder treatment (e.g. interoceptive exposure) to the treatmentof agoraphobia, even when there is no current panic disorder diagnosis.• Individuals with agoraphobia may employ a variety of different behavioural strategies ifrequired to enter feared situations. One such safety behaviour is to require the presenceof a companion. Other strategies may include going to certain places only at particulartimes of day, or carrying specific materials (e.g. medications, towels) in case of the fearednegative outcome. These strategies may change over the course of the disorder and fromone occasion to the next. For example, on different occasions in the same situation anindividual may insist on having a companion, endure the situation with distress, or usevarious safety behaviours to cope with their anxiety.• Although the pattern of symptoms, the severity of the anxiety and the extent of avoidanceare variable, agoraphobia is one of the most impairing of the anxiety and fear-relateddisorders to the extent that some individuals become completely housebound; this has animpact on opportunities for employment, seeking medical care and the ability to form andmaintain relationships.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia Anxiety and fear-related disorders 277Boundary with normality (threshold)• Individuals may exhibit transient avoidance behaviours in the context of normaldevelopment or in periods of increased stress. These behaviours are differentiated fromagoraphobia because they are limited in duration and do not lead to significant impact onfunctioning.• Individuals with disabilities or medical conditions may avoid certain situations becauseof reasonable concerns about being incapacitated or embarrassed (e.g. a person with amobility limitation who is concerned that an unfamiliar location will not be accessible,a person with Crohn disease who is concerned about experiencing sudden diarrhoea).Agoraphobia should only be diagnosed if the anxiety and avoidance result in functionalimpairment that is greater than expected given the disability or health condition.Course features• The typical age of onset for agoraphobia is in late adolescence, with the majority ofindividuals experiencing onset before 35 years of age. However, age of onset is later (duringthe mid- to late 20s) for individuals without a history of panic attacks or pre-existingdiagnosis of panic disorder.

124,6B03,Specific phobia,"Specific phobia is characterised by a marked and excessive fear or anxiety that consistently occurs upon exposure or anticipation of exposure to one or more specific objects or situations (e.g., proximity to certain animals, flying, heights, closed spaces, sight of blood or injury) that is out of proportion to actual danger. The phobic objects or situations are avoided or else endured with intense fear or anxiety.

If functioning is maintained, it is only through significantadditional effort.Additional clinical features• Specific phobia encompasses fears of a broad and heterogeneous group of phobic stimuli.The most common are for particular animals (animal phobia), heights (acrophobia),enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), sight of blood or injury (blood-injury phobia), flying,driving, storms, darkness and medical/dental procedures. Individuals’ reactions to phobicstimuli can range from feelings of disgust and revulsion (often occurring in animal phobiasor blood-injury phobias), to anticipation of danger or harm (common across most typesof specific phobia) and physical symptoms such as fainting (most common in response toblood or injury).• The majority of individuals diagnosed with specific phobia report fear of multiple objectsor situations. A single diagnosis of specific phobia is assigned regardless of the numberof feared objects or situations. Unlike most phobic stimuli, which upon presentation oranticipation typically result in significant physiological arousal, individuals who fear thesight of blood, invasive medical procedures or injury may experience a vasovagal responsethat can result in a fainting spell.• Some individuals with specific phobia may report a history of having observed anotherperson (e.g. a caregiver) react with fear or anxiety when confronted by an object or situation,resulting in vicarious learning of a fear response to the object or situation. Others may havehad a direct negative experience with an object or situation (e.g. having been bitten by adog). However, previous negative experiences (direct or vicarious) are not necessary forthe development of the disorder.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia Anxiety and fear-related disorders 281• Some individuals report that their fear or anxiety for an object or situation is not excessive.As such, clinicians must consider whether the reported fear, anxiety or avoidance behaviouris disproportionate to the reasonable risk of harm, taking into consideration both acceptedcultural norms and the specific environmental conditions that the individual is normallysubjected to (e.g. fear of darkness may be justified in a neighbourhood where assaults arecommon at night).Boundary with normality (threshold)• In children and adolescents, some fears may be part of normal development (e.g. a youngchild who is afraid of dogs). Specific phobia should only be diagnosed if the fear or anxietyis excessive in comparison to that of other individuals at a similar developmental level.Course features• Onset of specific phobia can occur at any age; however, initial onset is most commonduring early childhood (between 7 and 10 years of age), typically as a result of witnessingor experiencing a fear-provoking situation or event (e.g. choking, being attacked by ananimal, witnessing someone drown).• Younger age of onset has been associated with phobias related to animal and naturalphenomena (fear of still water/weather, closed spaces), whereas fear of flying and height-related phobias generally have an older age of onset.• Younger age of onset is also associated with an increased number of feared situationsor stimuli.• Individuals with specific phobia report high lifetime rates of co-occurringdisorders – particularly depressive disorders and other anxiety and fear-related disorders.In the majority of cases, specific phobia precedes the onset of other mental disorders.• Specific phobias that persist from childhood into adolescence and adulthood rarelyremit spontaneously.Developmental presentations• Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhoodand adolescence. Among these conditions, specific phobia is one of the most common inyoung children, and may present in children as young as 3 years of age.• In children, the diagnosis of specific phobia should not be assigned when the fears aredevelopmentally normative (e.g. fear of the dark in young children).• In preschool-aged children, phobic responses may include freezing, tantrums or crying.Duration, frequency and intensity of these reactions may be used to distinguish betweenage-typical fears and anxiety responses in specific phobia.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia 282 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Specific phobias related to tangible objects (e.g. animals) are more common in youngerchildren, whereas those relating to possible harm to oneself or others (e.g. environmental,blood/injection) are more common in adolescents and adults.• As with adults, excessive avoidance is seen in both children and adolescents, and maybe driven by either the actual presence of the phobic stimuli or anticipatory anxiety(e.g. refusing to go outside because of the possible presence of bees).Culture-related features• Culture may play a role in shaping the fear response to specific stimuli. A diagnosis ofspecific phobia should not be assigned if a stimulus is feared by most people in a culturalgroup, unless the fear exceeds cultural norms. For example, people from some culturalgroups may avoid walking at night in certain areas where they fear ghosts or spirits maybe present.• The salience of specific feared stimuli may differ by cultural group and environmentalcontext. Common threats in the environment (e.g. poisonous snakes) may account forsome of the cultural variation in feared stimuli.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Lifetime prevalence of specific phobia is approximately twice as high among females.• Whereas males and females are equally likely to experience phobias related to blood,injection and injury, situationally specific phobias and those related to animals and naturalenvironments are more common among females.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with panic disorderIf an individual with specific phobia experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context ofactual or anticipated encounters with the specific object or situation that represents the focusof apprehension, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted, and the presenceof panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks specifier.

In contrast, in specificphobia the fear and avoidance are related to the specific object or situation itself.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumaticstress disorderBoth specific phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder involve avoidance of stimuli that causeanxiety, and both may arise following exposure to a traumatic event. Post-traumatic stress disordercan be differentiated from specific phobia by the presence of the other core symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (re-experiencing the trauma and persistent perceptions of heightenedcurrent threat). They are further differentiated by the fact that – unlike in specific phobia, inwhich the memories of the related traumatic event are experienced as belonging to the past – inpost-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, the traumatic event isexperienced as if it were occurring again in the here and now (i.e. re-experiencing).Boundary with feeding and eating disordersIndividuals with feeding and eating disorders exhibit abnormal eating behaviour and/orpreoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight or shape concerns, and may avoidfood because they fear it will lead to weight gain or because of its specific sensory qualities. Insome specific phobias, individuals may avoid eating or food stimuli, but the avoidance is related tothe anticipated direct effect of the phobic stimulus (e.g. eating may lead to choking or vomiting)rather than because of the caloric content or sensory qualities of the food itself.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIrritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children andadolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to interact with astimulus or enter situations that make them feel anxious (e.g. asking a child who fears dogs to goto the park where dogs might be present). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggeredby a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiantdisorder is generally not appropriate.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia 284 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders",Specific phobia,"Disorder Name: Specific phobiaDisorder Code: 6B03Disorder symptoms: Specific phobia is characterised by a marked and excessive fear or anxiety that consistently occurs upon exposure or anticipation of exposure to one or more specific objects or situations (e.g., proximity to certain animals, flying, heights, closed spaces, sight of blood or injury) that is out of proportion to actual danger.

Insome specific phobias, individuals may avoid eating or food stimuli, but the avoidance is related tothe anticipated direct effect of the phobic stimulus (e.g. eating may lead to choking or vomiting)rather than because of the caloric content or sensory qualities of the food itself.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIrritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children andadolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to interact with astimulus or enter situations that make them feel anxious (e.g. asking a child who fears dogs to goto the park where dogs might be present). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggeredby a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiantdisorder is generally not appropriate.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia 284 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders"
125,6B04,Social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety that consistently occurs in one or more social situations such as social interactions (e.g. having a conversation), doing something while feeling observed (e.g. eating or drinking in the presence of others), or performing in front of others (e.g. giving a speech). The individual is concerned that he or she will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated by others.

Children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder may alsoevidence social skills deficits, such as difficulty with starting or maintaining conversationsor asserting their wishes or opinions.• Social anxiety disorder symptoms may only become evident with the start of school,with the onset of demands to interact socially with unfamiliar peers and teachers. Themanifestations of social anxiety disorder may also vary across age groups, with youngerchildren more likely to exhibit social anxiety primarily with adults, and adolescentsmore likely to experience increased social anxiety with peers.

For example, taijinkyofusho among Japanese people and related conditions among people in the Republic ofKorea may represent a form of social anxiety disorder associated with the fear that otherswill be offended by one’s own inappropriate social behaviour (e.g. inappropriate gaze orfacial expression, blushing, body odour, loud bowel sounds).

However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panicdisorder may be assigned.Boundary with agoraphobiaFear or anxiety in agoraphobia centres on imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g.panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation or embarrassing physical symptoms) that areanticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficultrather than on concerns about being negatively evaluated by others. Unlike social anxiety disorder,embarrassment in agoraphobia is secondary to concerns that escape or obtaining assistance maynot be possible should symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea in a public place) occur.Boundary with specific phobiaSpecific phobia can be differentiated from social anxiety disorder because, in general, fears areof specific situations or stimuli (e.g. heights, animals, blood-injury) and not of social situations.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder 288 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with selective mutismSelective mutism is characterized by a failure to speak in specific situations, whereas in socialanxiety disorder fear and anxiety result in avoidance of multiple social contexts.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder may both appear tobe socially withdrawn. However, those with autism spectrum disorder can be differentiatedbecause of the presence of social communication deficits and, typically, a lack of interest in socialinteractions.Boundary with depressive disordersBeliefs of social inadequacy, rejection and failure are common in depressive disorders, and maybe associated with avoidance of social situations. However, unlike in social anxiety disorder, thesesymptoms occur almost exclusively during a depressive episode.Boundary with body dysmorphic disorderIn body dysmorphic disorder, individuals worry about a perceived physical defect that is oftenundetectable or very minor from the point of view of others. These individuals may be concernedabout others’ negative judgement of the perceived defect. However, unlike in social anxietydisorder, their concerns are restricted to how others will evaluate the perceived defect rather thanother aspects of their behaviour or appearance across social contexts.Boundary with olfactory reference disorderIn social anxiety disorder, social situations are avoided because the individual is concerned thatthey will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e.be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejection or be offensive). In contrast, individuals witholfactory reference disorder may avoid social situations specifically because they believe they areemitting a foul odour.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIrritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children andadolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to enter situations thatmake them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to attend a social gathering).

An additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should onlybe assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met, taking into consideration that it is normal forindividuals with visible symptoms of a medical condition to experience some concerns about howothers perceive their symptoms.

126,6B05,Separation anxiety disorder,"Separation anxiety disorder is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from specific attachment figures. In children and adolescents, separation anxiety typically focuses on caregivers, parents or other family members and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentally normative. In adults, the focus is typically a romantic partner or children. Manifestations of separation anxiety may include thoughts of harm or untoward events befalling the attachment figure, reluctance to go to school or work, recurrent excessive distress upon separation, reluctance or refusal to sleep away from the attachment figure, and recurrent nightmares about separation. The symptoms persist for at least several months and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.",,mood [affective] disorders; Selective mutism; Social anxiety disorder,"Separation anxiety disorderEssential (required) features• Marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whomthe person is attached (i.e. with whom the individual has a deep emotional bond) isrequired for diagnosis. In children and adolescents, key attachment figures that are mostcommonly the focus of separation anxiety include parents, caregivers and other familymembers, and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentallynormative. In adults, separation anxiety most often involves a spouse, romantic partner orchildren. Manifestations of fear or anxiety related to separation depend on the individual’sdevelopmental level, but may include:• persistent thoughts that harm or some other untoward event (e.g. being kidnapped) willlead to separation;• reluctance or refusal to go to school or work;• recurrent excessive distress (e.g. tantrums, social withdrawal) related to being separatedfrom the attachment figure;• reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near the attachment figure;• recurrent nightmares about separation;• physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or headache on occasionsthat involve separation from the attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to schoolor work.• The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g.at least several months).• The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia,personality disorder).• The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptomsor significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significantadditional effort.Additional clinical features• Separation anxiety disorder frequently co-occurs with other mental, behavioural andneurodevelopmental disorders. In children and adolescents, common co-occurringdisorders include generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. In adults, frequentlyco-occurring disorders include mood disorders, other anxiety and fear-related disorders,post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorder.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder 290 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Although separation anxiety disorder may exhibit a lifelong course with onset inchildhood, a significant proportion of adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recalla childhood onset.• Separation anxiety disorder in childhood is frequently associated with a parenting stylethat interferes with the development of autonomy and self-mastery expected for thatperson’s cultural context (e.g. the parent does not permit the child to engage independentlyin basic activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing).Boundary with normality (threshold)• Many situations involving separation are associated with other potential stressors or arenormal sources of anxiety (e.g. leaving home to start a job or attend university in a newcity). Separation anxiety disorder is differentiated based on the focus of apprehensionbeing on separation from a key attachment figure rather than on other aspects of adjustingto novel circumstances.• Strong attachment to loved ones is a normal and healthy part of life, and separation fromthese individuals may be associated with transient sadness or anxiety. Preschool-agedchildren may show a moderate or even greater degree of anxiety over real or threatenedseparation from people to whom they are attached. These reactions are considereddevelopmentally appropriate, and are differentiated from separation anxiety disorder onthe basis of the persistence of the symptoms (e.g. lasting for several months) with repeatedseparations, evidence of excessive preoccupations about the well-being of attachmentfigures, persistent avoidance, and significant distress or impairment in functioning as aconsequence of the symptoms.• Among children and adolescents, school refusal is a common occurrence, and may bebased on transient anxiety about separation from a loved one or be symptomatic ofseparation anxiety disorder. However, especially in adolescence, anxiety about school orschool refusal is not typically related to fear of separation but rather to other factors suchas truancy, peer rejection or bullying.Course features• The typical onset of separation anxiety disorder is during childhood, and the disorder canpersist into adulthood. Initial disorder onset during adolescence and adulthood may beless common.• Separation anxiety disorder has been associated with elevated risk of developing a widerange of internalizing disorders, including depressive disorders, bipolar disorders andanxiety and fear-related disorders. There is also evidence of elevated risk of disruptivebehaviour and dissocial disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 291Developmental presentations• Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhoodand adolescence. Among these disorders, separation anxiety disorder is one of the mostcommon in young children.• In children, the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder should not be used to describedevelopmentally normative phenomena.• The focus of apprehension in separation anxiety disorder may differ across age groups, suchthat younger children may demonstrate less credible fears (e.g. worrying about sleepingalone for fear they will be kidnapped in the middle of the night), whereas older childrenand adolescents may have more credible fears (e.g. parents being in a car accident).• Symptom presentation varies with age. In younger children, who are less able to expressworries or fears, behavioural manifestations of recurrent excessive distress are typicallymore prominent, such as tantrums or crying when separated from parents and caregivers.When at home, younger children may insist on following caregivers closely, exhibitingdistress even when in a different room or on a different floor from parents or caregivers.Older children are usually able to express their preoccupations about separation fromattachment figures or fears related to specific dangers (e.g. accidents, kidnapping,mugging, death). Older children and adolescents may be more likely to demonstrate socialwithdrawal, insisting on staying at home with family members rather than spending timewith peers.Culture-related features• Cultural variation exists with regard to tolerating separation from attachment figures. Insome cultural groups, it would be considered inappropriate to spend time apart from familyor loved ones. Distress associated with separation in this sociocultural context should notbe considered excessive if it is culturally normative.• Children in some cultures remain in their parental home longer than in other cultures, andgenerally this trend is increasing globally, so the assignment of disorder should take intoaccount cultural norms.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although lifetime prevalence rates for separation anxiety disorder are slightly higheramong females than males (5.6% versus 4%), during childhood, school refusal is equallyprevalent for both genders.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder 292 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with generalized anxiety disorderIndividuals with generalized anxiety disorder experience chronic and excessive worry about avariety of everyday life events that can include preoccupation about the safety of key attachmentfigures. However, these concerns seldom occur without additional worries regarding otherdomains of everyday life.Boundary with panic disorderIf an individual with separation anxiety disorder experiences panic attacks exclusively in thecontext of separation from key attachment figures, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder isnot warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacksspecifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panicdisorder may be assigned.Boundary with agoraphobiaIn agoraphobia, individuals avoid a variety of situations, including leaving home alone, but thefear or anxiety is centred on the possibility that help will not be available in the event of a panicattack or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms rather than concerns about separationfrom key attachment figures.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIn social anxiety disorder, the avoidance of social situations is in response to fear or anxietyabout being negatively evaluated by others rather than concerns about being separated from keyattachment figures.Boundary with depressive disordersBeliefs of social inadequacy, rejection and failure are common in depressive disorders, andmay be associated with avoidance of leaving the home and being separated from loved ones.However, unlike in separation anxiety disorder, these symptoms occur almost exclusively duringa depressive episode.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder, individuals have a history of exposure to a traumatic eventthat may have involved the loss of a key attachment figure. However, the focus of apprehensionis on intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic event from memory and avoidance of associatedstimuli rather than concerns about future loss of or harm coming to the key attachment figure.Nevertheless, separation anxiety disorder rather than post-traumatic stress disorder may occursubsequent to the experience of a traumatic event, and if all diagnostic requirements are met, thediagnosis can be assigned.Boundary with disruptive behaviour and dissocial disordersIndividuals with oppositional defiant disorder can exhibit similar behaviours to those observedin separation anxiety disorder, such as anger, irritability and temper outbursts, or defiant andheadstrong behaviour (e.g. refusal to leave home or go to school). However, in separationanxiety disorder these occur exclusively as a result of anticipated or actual separation from akey attachment figure.

Personality disorder may co-occur with separation anxietydisorder and, if present, can be diagnosed separately.",Separation anxiety disorder,"Disorder Name: Separation anxiety disorderDisorder Code: 6B05Disorder symptoms: Separation anxiety disorder is characterised by marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from specific attachment figures. In children and adolescents, separation anxiety typically focuses on caregivers, parents or other family members and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentally normative. In adults, the focus is typically a romantic partner or children. Manifestations of separation anxiety may include thoughts of harm or untoward events befalling the attachment figure, reluctance to go to school or work, recurrent excessive distress upon separation, reluctance or refusal to sleep away from the attachment figure, and recurrent nightmares about separation. The symptoms persist for at least several months and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.If you diagnose this disease exclude: mood [affective] disorders; Selective mutism; Social anxiety disorderSeparation anxiety disorderEssential (required) features• Marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whomthe person is attached (i.e. with whom the individual has a deep emotional bond) isrequired for diagnosis. In children and adolescents, key attachment figures that are mostcommonly the focus of separation anxiety include parents, caregivers and other familymembers, and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentallynormative. In adults, separation anxiety most often involves a spouse, romantic partner orchildren. Manifestations of fear or anxiety related to separation depend on the individual’sdevelopmental level, but may include:• persistent thoughts that harm or some other untoward event (e.g. being kidnapped) willlead to separation;• reluctance or refusal to go to school or work;• recurrent excessive distress (e.g. tantrums, social withdrawal) related to being separatedfrom the attachment figure;• reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near the attachment figure;• recurrent nightmares about separation;• physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or headache on occasionsthat involve separation from the attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to schoolor work.• The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g.at least several months).• The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia,personality disorder).• The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptomsor significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significantadditional effort.Additional clinical features• Separation anxiety disorder frequently co-occurs with other mental, behavioural andneurodevelopmental disorders. In children and adolescents, common co-occurringdisorders include generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. In adults, frequentlyco-occurring disorders include mood disorders, other anxiety and fear-related disorders,post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorder.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder 290 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Although separation anxiety disorder may exhibit a lifelong course with onset inchildhood, a significant proportion of adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recalla childhood onset.• Separation anxiety disorder in childhood is frequently associated with a parenting stylethat interferes with the development of autonomy and self-mastery expected for thatperson’s cultural context (e.g. the parent does not permit the child to engage independentlyin basic activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing).Boundary with normality (threshold)• Many situations involving separation are associated with other potential stressors or arenormal sources of anxiety (e.g. leaving home to start a job or attend university in a newcity). Separation anxiety disorder is differentiated based on the focus of apprehensionbeing on separation from a key attachment figure rather than on other aspects of adjustingto novel circumstances.• Strong attachment to loved ones is a normal and healthy part of life, and separation fromthese individuals may be associated with transient sadness or anxiety. Preschool-agedchildren may show a moderate or even greater degree of anxiety over real or threatenedseparation from people to whom they are attached. These reactions are considereddevelopmentally appropriate, and are differentiated from separation anxiety disorder onthe basis of the persistence of the symptoms (e.g. lasting for several months) with repeatedseparations, evidence of excessive preoccupations about the well-being of attachmentfigures, persistent avoidance, and significant distress or impairment in functioning as aconsequence of the symptoms.• Among children and adolescents, school refusal is a common occurrence, and may bebased on transient anxiety about separation from a loved one or be symptomatic ofseparation anxiety disorder. However, especially in adolescence, anxiety about school orschool refusal is not typically related to fear of separation but rather to other factors suchas truancy, peer rejection or bullying.Course features• The typical onset of separation anxiety disorder is during childhood, and the disorder canpersist into adulthood. Initial disorder onset during adolescence and adulthood may beless common.• Separation anxiety disorder has been associated with elevated risk of developing a widerange of internalizing disorders, including depressive disorders, bipolar disorders andanxiety and fear-related disorders. There is also evidence of elevated risk of disruptivebehaviour and dissocial disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 291Developmental presentations• Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhoodand adolescence. Among these disorders, separation anxiety disorder is one of the mostcommon in young children.• In children, the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder should not be used to describedevelopmentally normative phenomena.• The focus of apprehension in separation anxiety disorder may differ across age groups, suchthat younger children may demonstrate less credible fears (e.g. worrying about sleepingalone for fear they will be kidnapped in the middle of the night), whereas older childrenand adolescents may have more credible fears (e.g. parents being in a car accident).• Symptom presentation varies with age. In younger children, who are less able to expressworries or fears, behavioural manifestations of recurrent excessive distress are typicallymore prominent, such as tantrums or crying when separated from parents and caregivers.When at home, younger children may insist on following caregivers closely, exhibitingdistress even when in a different room or on a different floor from parents or caregivers.Older children are usually able to express their preoccupations about separation fromattachment figures or fears related to specific dangers (e.g. accidents, kidnapping,mugging, death). Older children and adolescents may be more likely to demonstrate socialwithdrawal, insisting on staying at home with family members rather than spending timewith peers.Culture-related features• Cultural variation exists with regard to tolerating separation from attachment figures. Insome cultural groups, it would be considered inappropriate to spend time apart from familyor loved ones. Distress associated with separation in this sociocultural context should notbe considered excessive if it is culturally normative.• Children in some cultures remain in their parental home longer than in other cultures, andgenerally this trend is increasing globally, so the assignment of disorder should take intoaccount cultural norms.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although lifetime prevalence rates for separation anxiety disorder are slightly higheramong females than males (5.6% versus 4%), during childhood, school refusal is equallyprevalent for both genders.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder 292 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with generalized anxiety disorderIndividuals with generalized anxiety disorder experience chronic and excessive worry about avariety of everyday life events that can include preoccupation about the safety of key attachmentfigures. However, these concerns seldom occur without additional worries regarding otherdomains of everyday life.Boundary with panic disorderIf an individual with separation anxiety disorder experiences panic attacks exclusively in thecontext of separation from key attachment figures, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder isnot warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacksspecifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panicdisorder may be assigned.Boundary with agoraphobiaIn agoraphobia, individuals avoid a variety of situations, including leaving home alone, but thefear or anxiety is centred on the possibility that help will not be available in the event of a panicattack or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms rather than concerns about separationfrom key attachment figures.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIn social anxiety disorder, the avoidance of social situations is in response to fear or anxietyabout being negatively evaluated by others rather than concerns about being separated from keyattachment figures.Boundary with depressive disordersBeliefs of social inadequacy, rejection and failure are common in depressive disorders, andmay be associated with avoidance of leaving the home and being separated from loved ones.However, unlike in separation anxiety disorder, these symptoms occur almost exclusively duringa depressive episode.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder, individuals have a history of exposure to a traumatic eventthat may have involved the loss of a key attachment figure. However, the focus of apprehensionis on intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic event from memory and avoidance of associatedstimuli rather than concerns about future loss of or harm coming to the key attachment figure.Nevertheless, separation anxiety disorder rather than post-traumatic stress disorder may occursubsequent to the experience of a traumatic event, and if all diagnostic requirements are met, thediagnosis can be assigned.Boundary with disruptive behaviour and dissocial disordersIndividuals with oppositional defiant disorder can exhibit similar behaviours to those observedin separation anxiety disorder, such as anger, irritability and temper outbursts, or defiant andheadstrong behaviour (e.g. refusal to leave home or go to school). However, in separationanxiety disorder these occur exclusively as a result of anticipated or actual separation from akey attachment figure. School refusal or truancy may occur in the context of conduct-dissocialdisorder, but the behaviour is not related to concerns for the well-being of a key attachment figure.Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder Anxiety and fear-related disorders 293Boundary with personality disorderFear of abandonment or dependency on others can occur as symptoms of an enduringmaladaptive pattern of behaviour associated with personality disorder. These symptoms tendto occur with other broader disruptions to interpersonal functioning, emotion regulation, andidentity formation and definition.

132,6B20.Z,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified",,,,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecifiedAdditional clinical features• The content of obsessions and compulsions varies among individuals, and can be groupedinto different themes or symptom dimensions, including cleaning (i.e. contaminationobsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (i.e. symmetry obsessions and repeating,ordering and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g. aggressive, sexualand religious obsessions) and related compulsions. Some individuals have difficultiesdiscarding objects, and accumulate (i.e. hoard) them as a consequence of typical obsessions,such as fears of harming others (see boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and relateddisorders under hoarding disorder). Individuals usually manifest symptoms on more thanone dimension.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder 302 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Although compulsions are not done for pleasure, their performance may result intemporary relief from anxiety or distress, or a temporary sense of completeness.• Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder experience a range of affects whenconfronted with situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. These affects caninclude marked anxiety or panic attacks, strong feelings of disgust or a distressing sense ofincompleteness or uneasiness until things look, feel or sound just right.• Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often avoid people, places and things thattrigger obsessions and compulsions.• Common beliefs in obsessive-compulsive disorder include an inflated sense of responsibility,overestimation of threat, perfectionism, intolerance of uncertainty and overvaluation ofthe power of thoughts (e.g. believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as actingon it).• The severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology varies such that someindividuals spend a few hours per day obsessing or engaging in compulsions, whereasothers have near constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating.• When both obsessions and compulsions are present there is typically a discerniblerelationship between them in content or temporal sequence. Compulsions are mostoften performed in response to obsessions (e.g. excessive hand washing due to fear ofcontamination). However, in some individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder,particularly during the initial phase of the disorder, compulsions may precede themanifestation of obsessions. For example, an individual begins to feel that they must beafraid of an accidental fire because they repeatedly check the gas knob on the stove, oran individual concludes that they must be afraid of contamination based on the evidenceof their repeated hand washing. Understanding the relationship between obsessions andcompulsions can assist in intervention selection and treatment planning.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Intrusive thoughts, images and impulses/urges, as well as repetitive behaviours, areprevalent among the general population (e.g. thoughts of harming a loved one, double-checking that the door is locked). Obsessive-compulsive disorder should only be diagnosedwhen obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (e.g. take more than 1 hour perday), cause significant distress or result in functional impairment.• Developmentally normative preoccupations (e.g. worrying about interacting withstrangers in young children) and rituals (e.g. skipping over cracks in a sidewalk) shouldnot be attributed to a presumptive diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. These aredifferentiated from obsessions and compulsions characteristic of obsessive-compulsivedisorder because they are transient, age-appropriate and not time-consuming (e.g. takingmore than hour per day), and they do not result in significant distress or impairment.Course features• Obsessive-compulsive disorder typically has an age of onset in the late teens and early 20s,with late onset (after 35 years of age) less common. In cases of late onset, there is often ahistory of chronic subclinical symptoms.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 303• Onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms is often gradual. Sudden or late onset,in particular, should prompt additional assessment to differentiate obsessive-compulsivedisorder from other medical conditions (e.g. basal ganglia ischaemic stroke) that maybetter explain the symptoms.• Many adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (30–50%) report a childhood onset ofsymptoms. For those with onset during childhood or adolescence, 40% may experienceremission of symptoms by early adulthood.• Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults is generally considered a chronic condition, withwaxing and waning of symptoms. Some experience an episodic course and a minorityexperience a worsening course.Developmental presentations• Onset before the age of 10 years is more common among males (approximately 25%),whereas adolescent onset is more likely among females. Younger age of onset is associatedwith greater genetic loading and poorer outcomes due to interference of symptoms withachieving developmental milestones (e.g. forming peer relationships, acquiring academicskills). Although childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder typically follows achronic course, particularly if left untreated, symptoms tend to wax and wane and many(approximately 40%) experience full remission by early adulthood. Among older adults, theprevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder is slightly higher among men than women.• Although precipitous onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in children andadolescents has been reported, often attributed to paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatricdisorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), development of symptomsis typically gradual.• The content and type of obsessions and compulsions varies across the lifespan. Childrenand adolescents are more likely to report obsessions centred upon bad things happeningto their loved ones (e.g. parents), whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to reportreligious or sexual obsessions. Among children and adolescents, females are more likely toreport symptoms centred upon contamination or cleaning, whereas males are more likelyto report symptoms of a sexual, religious or aggressive nature. It may be easier to assess forthe presence of compulsions in children because their level of cognitive development maypreclude verbalizing content of obsessions.• Among children and adolescents, the course of obsessive-compulsive disorder is frequentlycomplicated by the co-occurrence of other mental disorders, the presence of which mayaffect identification of obsessive-compulsive disorder among young people.

Co-occurring tics are more commonamong males with childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder. Children andadolescents are also more likely than adults to present with a combination of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a primary tic disorder and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Body dysmorphic disorder or hoarding disorder often co-occur among adolescents withobsessive-compulsive disorder. Approximately half of elderly patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder exhibit ordering, hoarding and checking behaviours, which may alsoreflect symptoms of personality disorder with anankastic traits.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder 304 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• Similar types of obsessive-compulsivity disorder symptoms (e.g. concerns withcontamination) are present cross-culturally, but cultural variation exists in the salienceand prevalence of certain themes of content of obsessions and compulsions. For example,aggressive obsessions have been found to predominate in Brazil, and religious/scrupulosityconcerns in Middle Eastern settings. In addition, scrupulosity obsessions may be moredistressing among individuals of certain faith groups that emphasize ritual exactitudeor the sinful nature of certain kinds of thoughts. The influence of culture may lead tothe adoption of specific themes, such as obsessions about kashrut (dietary restrictions)observances among Jews, or about being in a state of uncleanliness (napak) amongMuslims. Distinguishing religious compulsions from zealous but normative religiouspractice may require the help of religious experts aware of local norms.• Etiological attributions may vary across social groups, including biological, psychological,social and supernatural or spiritual explanations. These attributions may also shape thespecific obsessions, such as concerns about being deserving of punishment as the result ofa transgression or the object of sorcery, witchcraft or the evil eye. In some cultural groups,compulsions may be reinforced by the belief that such acts ward off evil spirits or haveanother spiritual function.• Help-seeking behaviour and clinical disclosure are less likely when the obsessions orcompulsions are considered by the individual to be culturally taboo.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Males are more likely to experience obsessive-compulsive disorder during childhood,with approximately 25% experiencing onset before the age of 10 years. During adulthood,prevalence is higher among females.• Males are more likely to experience co-occurring primary tic disorders.• Gender differences in the specific content of obsessions and compulsions have beenreported, whereby females are more likely to report cleaning and contamination-relatedthemes, and males are more likely to report symmetry-related themes and taboo intrusivethoughts (e.g. violent impulses, sacrilegious images).• Onset or exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive disorder has been reported during theperipartum period.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 305Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)Hypochondriasis is characterized by persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility ofhaving one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses. Although obsessions inobsessive-compulsive disorder may be health-related, when these occur, they tend to be focusedmore on potential contamination than on the undiagnosed symptoms of a particular illness, andto be accompanied by a history of other obsessions that are not health-related.Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disordersRecurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviours occur in other obsessive-compulsive and relateddisorders, but the foci of apprehension and form of repetitive behaviours are distinct for eachdiagnostic entity. In body dysmorphic disorder, the intrusive thoughts and repetitive behavioursare limited to concerns about physical appearance. In trichotillomania or excoriation disorder,the repetitive behaviours are limited to hair pulling or skin picking, respectively, in the absenceof obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms include excessive accumulation or difficultydiscarding possessions and marked distress related to discarding items. Hoarding behaviourcan be symptomatic of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but in contrast to hoarding disorder it isundertaken with the goal of neutralizing or reducing concomitant distress and anxiety arisingfrom obsessional content such as aggressive (e.g. fear of harming others), sexual/religious (e.g.fear of committing blasphemous or disrespectful acts), contamination (e.g. fear of spreadinginfectious diseases) or symmetry/ordering (e.g. feeling of incompleteness) themes. However,obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can co-occur, and multiple diagnoses from thisgrouping may be assigned if warranted.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderPersistent repetitive thoughts, images or impulses/urges (i.e. obsessions) and/or repetitivebehaviours (i.e. compulsions) characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder may be difficult todistinguish from restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activitiesthat are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder. However, unlike those with autism spectrumdisorder, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder feel driven to perform repetitivebehaviours in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, to reduce anxiety or to achievea sense of completeness. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can also be distinguished from autismspectrum disorder because difficulties in initiating and sustaining social communication andreciprocal social interactions are not features of obsessive-compulsive disorder.Boundary with stereotyped movement disorderStereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months)presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmicmovements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting). Thesemovements are typically less complex than compulsions, and are not aimed at neutralizingobsessions.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder 306 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disordersSome individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder lack insight about the irrationality of theirthoughts and behaviours to such an extent that their conviction of the veracity of their obsessions– and the strength of beliefs regarding the connection between compulsions and obsessions –may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction and fixity with which thesebeliefs are held (see insight specifiers, p. 301). If these beliefs are restricted to fear or convictionthat intrusive thoughts, images or impulses/urges are true, or that compulsions are realisticallyconnected to obsessional content in an individual without a history of other delusions – thatis, these beliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of obsessive-compulsivedisorder and are fully consistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed instead of delusional disorder. Individuals withobsessive-compulsive disorder do not exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations orformal thought disorder).Boundary with depressive disordersDifferentiating rumination that occurs in the context of depressive disorders from obsessionsand compulsive mental acts characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder is challenging.Nonetheless, it may be helpful to consider that ruminations are typically congruent with negativeaffect and reflect depressive cognition (e.g. self-criticism, guilt, failure, regret, pessimism,hopelessness). Unlike obsessions, ruminations are not typically experienced as intrusive; nor arethey linked to compulsive behaviours. In contrast to ruminations, compulsive mental acts aretypically performed with the intention of reducing distress or perceived risk of harm. Individualswith depressive disorders experience low mood or a lack of interest in pleasurable activities, whichare not diagnostic features of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, obsessive-compulsivedisorder and depressive disorders often co-occur, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the fulldiagnostic requirements for each are met.Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disordersRecurrent thoughts, avoidance behaviours and requests for reassurance commonly observedin obsessive-compulsive disorder also occur in anxiety and fear-related disorders. In contrastto anxiety and fear-related disorders, however, obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorderare experienced as intrusive, can involve content that is odd or irrational (e.g. intrusive imagesof harming a friend), and are typically accompanied by compulsions. Obsessive-compulsivedisorder is further differentiated by not being characterized by the same foci of apprehension thatcharacterize anxiety and fear-related disorders. For example, in generalized anxiety disorder, therecurrent thoughts or worries are focused on negative events that could possibly occur in differentaspects of everyday life (e.g. work, finances, health, family). In social anxiety disorder, symptomsare in response to feared social situations (e.g. speaking in public, initiating a conversation) andconcerns about being negatively evaluated by others. In specific phobia, symptoms are limitedto one or a few circumscribed phobic objects or situations (e.g. fear and avoidance of animals),and concerns are about the perceived harm that could arise if exposed to these stimuli (e.g. beingbitten by an animal).Boundary with panic disorderPanic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. Some individuals withobsessive-compulsive disorder experience panic attacks that are triggered by feared stimuliassociated with obsessions and compulsions or if the individual is prevented from enactingneutralizing compulsions. If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder experiences panicattacks exclusively in relation to obsessions or compulsions without the presence of unexpectedpanic attacks, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted. However, if unexpectedpanic attacks are also present and all other diagnostic requirements are met, both diagnoses maybe assigned.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 307Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder, symptoms are limited to stimuli associated with or that serveas reminders of a traumatic event (e.g. fear and avoidance of a place where an individual wasassaulted) and the intrusive thoughts and images are associated with the traumatic event.Boundary with eating disordersObsessive-compulsive disorder can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosaand binge-eating disorder because obsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns aboutbeing or becoming overweight, and are not accompanied by body-image distortions.Boundary with disorders due to substance use and impulse control disordersA variety of behaviours may be described by lay people and sometimes by health professionals ascompulsive, including sexual behaviour, gambling and substance use. Compulsions characteristicof obsessive-compulsive disorder are differentiated from these behaviours in that they typicallylack a rational motivation, and are rarely reported to be pleasurable, although they may reduceanxiety or distress. Behaviours such as sexual behaviour, gambling and substance abuse are alsonot typically preceded by intrusive unwanted thoughts characteristic of obsessions, although theyare often preceded by thoughts about engaging in the relevant behaviour.Boundary with primary tics and tic disorders including Tourette syndromeA tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g. eyeblinking, throat clearing). Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be differentiated from tic disordersbecause, unlike compulsions, tics appear unintentional in nature and clearly utilize a discretemuscle group. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between complex tics and compulsionsassociated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although tics (both complex and simple) arepreceded by premonitory sensory urges, which diminish as tics occur, tics are not aimed atneutralizing antecedent cognitions (e.g. obsessions) or reducing anxiety. Many individuals exhibitsymptoms of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and primary tic disorders – in particular,Tourette syndrome – and both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for eachare met.Boundary with personality disorder with prominent anankastic featuresPersonality disorder with prominent anankastic features involves an enduring and pervasivemaladaptive pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. Individuals with personalitydisorder with prominent anankastic features do not experience intrusive thoughts, images, orimpulses/urges characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder, or engage in repetitive behavioursresponse to these intrusive thoughts. If diagnostic requirements for both obsessive-compulsivedisorder and a personality disorder with prominent anankastic features are met, both diagnosesmay be assigned.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder 308 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified","Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecifiedAdditional clinical features• The content of obsessions and compulsions varies among individuals, and can be groupedinto different themes or symptom dimensions, including cleaning (i.e. contaminationobsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (i.e. symmetry obsessions and repeating,ordering and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g. aggressive, sexualand religious obsessions) and related compulsions. Some individuals have difficultiesdiscarding objects, and accumulate (i.e. hoard) them as a consequence of typical obsessions,such as fears of harming others (see boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and relateddisorders under hoarding disorder). Individuals usually manifest symptoms on more thanone dimension.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder 302 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Although compulsions are not done for pleasure, their performance may result intemporary relief from anxiety or distress, or a temporary sense of completeness.• Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder experience a range of affects whenconfronted with situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. These affects caninclude marked anxiety or panic attacks, strong feelings of disgust or a distressing sense ofincompleteness or uneasiness until things look, feel or sound just right.• Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often avoid people, places and things thattrigger obsessions and compulsions.• Common beliefs in obsessive-compulsive disorder include an inflated sense of responsibility,overestimation of threat, perfectionism, intolerance of uncertainty and overvaluation ofthe power of thoughts (e.g. believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as actingon it).• The severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology varies such that someindividuals spend a few hours per day obsessing or engaging in compulsions, whereasothers have near constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating.• When both obsessions and compulsions are present there is typically a discerniblerelationship between them in content or temporal sequence. Compulsions are mostoften performed in response to obsessions (e.g. excessive hand washing due to fear ofcontamination). However, in some individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder,particularly during the initial phase of the disorder, compulsions may precede themanifestation of obsessions. For example, an individual begins to feel that they must beafraid of an accidental fire because they repeatedly check the gas knob on the stove, oran individual concludes that they must be afraid of contamination based on the evidenceof their repeated hand washing. Understanding the relationship between obsessions andcompulsions can assist in intervention selection and treatment planning.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Intrusive thoughts, images and impulses/urges, as well as repetitive behaviours, areprevalent among the general population (e.g. thoughts of harming a loved one, double-checking that the door is locked). Obsessive-compulsive disorder should only be diagnosedwhen obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (e.g. take more than 1 hour perday), cause significant distress or result in functional impairment.• Developmentally normative preoccupations (e.g. worrying about interacting withstrangers in young children) and rituals (e.g. skipping over cracks in a sidewalk) shouldnot be attributed to a presumptive diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. These aredifferentiated from obsessions and compulsions characteristic of obsessive-compulsivedisorder because they are transient, age-appropriate and not time-consuming (e.g. takingmore than hour per day), and they do not result in significant distress or impairment.Course features• Obsessive-compulsive disorder typically has an age of onset in the late teens and early 20s,with late onset (after 35 years of age) less common. In cases of late onset, there is often ahistory of chronic subclinical symptoms.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 303• Onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms is often gradual.

Sometimes the preoccupation isvague or consists of a general perception of ugliness or being not right or being toomasculine/feminine.• Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder, can place affected individuals –usually males – at increased risk of complications requiring medical attention (e.g. muscletears, strains, side-effects of steroid use).• The risk of suicide in adolescents and adults with body dysmorphic disorder is high,particularly when depressive symptomatology co-occurs. Owing to the low baserate occurrence of attempted and completed suicide, it is difficult to predict suicidalbehaviours. Factors to consider in assessing risk include previous attempts, lack ofperceived psychosocial support, perception of burdensomeness and hopelessness. Itis also important to consider that identification of body dysmorphic disorder may beespecially challenging because the increased occurrence of shame and perceived stigmaamong affected individuals often leads them to conceal their difficulties, or to presentwith symptoms of depressive disorders, social anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsivedisorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder.• The diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder is typically made based on direct observationor physical examination of the perceived body flaws or defects. If this is not possiblebecause it is inappropriate, or the individual refuses to remove their camouflage, then itmay be difficult to make a judgement about how noticeable or abnormal a perceived defectObsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder 310 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersis. In such cases, corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informantor physician who has conducted a physical examination of the individual.• In some cases, individuals may be persistently preoccupied with one or more perceiveddefects or flaws in appearance, or ugliness in general, of another person – generally a childor a romantic partner – that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others.This phenomenon is often referred to as body dysmorphic disorder by proxy. If theother diagnostic requirements for the disorder are met with reference to the perceivedbodily flaws or defects of the other person (e.g. excessive self-consciousness, repetitiveand excessive examination or checking, marked camouflaging or alteration of theperceived defect, avoidance of relevant social situations or triggers, distress or functionalimpairment), a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder may be assigned to the individualexperiencing the preoccupation.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Body-image concerns are common in many cultures, especially during adolescence. Bodydysmorphic disorder is differentiated from body dissatisfaction or body-image concernsby the degree of preoccupation and frequency of related recurrent behaviours performed,as well as the degree of distress or interference the individual experiences as a consequenceof these symptoms.Course features• The onset of body dysmorphic disorder commonly occurs during adolescence, with twothirds of individuals reporting onset before the age of 18 years. Subclinical symptoms mayappear during early adolescence (at 12 or 13 years of age).• Although the typical course of body dysmorphic disorder involves a gradual worseningof symptoms from subclinical to full symptomatic presentation, some individuals mayexperience an acute onset of symptoms.• Among individuals with onset before the age of 18 years, body dysmorphic disorder isassociated with gradual onset of symptoms and co-occurring disorders. These individualsare also at greater risk of attempting suicide.• Body dysmorphic disorder is generally considered a chronic disorder.Developmental presentations• Notwithstanding a relatively early age of onset of body dysmorphic disorder, it typicallytakes 10–15 years before affected individuals seek help. New onset may occur among olderadults, although research with this age group is very limited.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 311• Onset of body dysmorphic disorder symptoms tends to be gradual. The disorder isrecurrent, chronic and likely to persist without intervention.• Prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder among adolescents is estimated at approximately2%, with higher prevalence among females. Prevalence rates are likely an underestimatebecause shame, embarrassment and stigma about symptoms frequently interfere withhelp-seeking behaviours.• Symptom presentation is similar across all age groups. However, differentiating betweennormality and body dysmorphic disorder in adolescence may be complicated by theemergence of developmentally normative concerns about body image that occur duringthis stage.• The course and severity of the disorder tends to be worse among individuals with anearlier onset (prior to the age of 18 years). Specifically, these individuals are at increasedrisk of suicide, present with more co-occurring mental disorders, have poorer insight,and are more likely to have experienced a gradual progression of symptom onset thanindividuals who develop body dysmorphic disorder in adulthood. Young people with bodydysmorphic disorder are also at increased risk of school dropout, potentially affecting theiracademic and social development.Culture-related features• The symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder are similar across cultures, but specificconcerns are shaped by cultural standards regarding what is considered attractive,acceptable, normal or desired. For example, populations in East Asia might be focusedon epicanthal folds, and concerns about skin colour may be associated with racializedconceptions of desirable body characteristics.• Within more collectivistic cultures, or cultures that emphasize shame, the nature ofthe concern about bodily deformities may be focused on anxiety about causing offenceto others.• Some cultural concepts of distress focus on perceptions of abnormal bodily features andmay shape the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder. For example, the shubo-kyofu (fearof a deformed body) subtype of taijin kyofusho has been reported primarily in Japan; itis characterized by intense fear of offending, embarrassing or hurting others through theperson’s appearance, which is perceived as deformed. Insight is typically poor to absent.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although prevalence rates are similar for both genders, differences in presentation havebeen described. Women are more likely to experience co-occurring eating disorders,whereas men are more likely to be concerned with the appearance of their genitalia andtheir overall physique (i.e. muscle dysmorphia).Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder 312 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)Hypochondriasis is characterized by persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility ofhaving one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses, whereas in body dysmorphicdisorder the preoccupation is with perceived flaws or defects in the individual’s appearance.Boundary with trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking)disorderHair pulling and skin picking can occur as symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder when there isa preoccupation with the skin or hair appearing defective and the intended aim is to improve itsappearance. In contrast, when the behaviour is a body-focused repetitive behaviour with no clearrelationship to a perceived defect on the skin or hair, then it is better classified as trichotillomaniaor excoriation disorder.Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disordersRecurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviours occur in other obsessive-compulsive and relateddisorders, but the foci of apprehension and form of repetitive behaviours are distinct for eachdiagnostic entity. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the intrusive thoughts and repetitivebehaviours are not limited to concerns about appearance but rather encompass a variety ofobsessions (e.g. of contamination, of causing harm) and compulsions (e.g. excessive washing,counting, checking) intended to neutralize these obsessions. In olfactory reference disorderindividuals are preoccupied exclusively with emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odour.However, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can co-occur, and multiple diagnoses fromthis grouping may be assigned if warranted.Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disordersMany individuals with body dysmorphic disorder lack insight about the irrationality of theirthoughts and behaviours to such an extent that convictions that their appearance is flawed may attimes appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held(see insight specifiers, p. 308). If these beliefs are restricted to the fear or conviction of having aflawed appearance or bodily defect in an individual without a history of other delusions – that is,these beliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of body dysmorphic disorderand are fully consistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – body dysmorphic disordershould be diagnosed instead of delusional disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorderdo not exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).Boundary with mood disordersIndividuals experiencing a depressive episode with psychotic symptoms may occasionallybecome preoccupied with perceived physical flaws or defects, which can be differentiated frombody dysmorphic disorder on the basis of the absence of such symptoms outside of the moodepisode. However, individuals with a history of body dysmorphic disorder commonly experienceco-occurring depressive symptoms as a consequence of the distress and impairment of their bodydysmorphic disorder symptoms. If depressive symptoms consistent with a mood disorder arepresent in an individual with body dysmorphic disorder, both disorders may be diagnosed.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 313Boundary with generalized anxiety disorderIn generalized anxiety disorder, recurrent thoughts or worries are focused on potential negativeoutcomes that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, work).Although some individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry excessively abouttheir appearance, these preoccupations occur together with worries about other aspects of life,are rarely delusional, and are not typically accompanied by the recurrent checking behaviourassociated with body dysmorphic disorder.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIn social anxiety disorder, symptoms are in response to feared social situations, and the primaryconcern is about the person’s own behaviour or manifestations of anxiety (e.g. fear they mayblush) being negatively evaluated by others. In contrast, individuals with body dysmorphicdisorder believe their appearance or a specific feature of their appearance (e.g. belief that skinappears permanently red) looks flawed. Some individuals with body dysmorphic disorderexperience significant anxiety in social situations, and fear they will be seen as ugly and thereforebe rejected. If their concerns are broader than the exclusive focus on their perceived flaws ordefects in appearance, and other symptoms of social anxiety disorder are present, both conditionsmay be diagnosed.Boundary with eating disordersBody dysmorphic disorder can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa andbinge-eating disorder because preoccupations in body dysmorphic disorder are not limited tobody-image concerns (i.e. idealized low body weight). Rather, the preoccupations can encompassa variety of idealized aspects of appearance. Some individuals with body dysmorphic disorderexhibit muscle dysmorphia such that they are preoccupied about being insufficiently muscular orlean and, in response, may exhibit unusual eating behaviours (e.g. excessive protein consumption)or engage in excessive exercise (e.g. weight lifting). In these cases, behaviours related to diet andexercise are motivated by a desire to be more muscular rather than to attain or maintain a lowbody weight. However, if low body weight idealization is central to the clinical presentation,and all other diagnostic requirements are met, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa instead of bodydysmorphic disorder should be assigned.Boundary with body integrity dysphoriaThe persistent preoccupation and excessive self-consciousness experienced by individuals withbody dysmorphic disorder derives from their concerns that an aspect of their body or appearanceis perceived by others to be ugly or deformed. In contrast, the persistent discomfort or intensenegative feelings about a particular body part (most commonly one or both arms or legs)experienced by individuals with the rare condition of body integrity dysphoria derives from theirsense that a part of their body is alien, or that the way their body is configured is wrong orunnatural. This leads to a desire to amputate or be rid of the particular body part rather thanwishing to improve its appearance.Boundary with gender incongruence of adolescence and adulthood and genderincongruence of childhoodGender incongruence of adolescence and adulthood and gender incongruence of childhooddiffer from body dysmorphic disorder in that in these conditions the preoccupation with aspectsof bodily appearance centres exclusively on the individual’s experience of a marked incongruencebetween their expressed or experienced gender and their biological sex. A common consequenceis that individuals will clearly state a desire to alter their primary and secondary sex characteristicssuch that they align with their experienced gender.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder 314 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Body dysmorphic disorder, unspecified","Body dysmorphic disorder, unspecifiedAdditional clinical features• Any part of the body may be the focus of the perceived flaws or defects, but the mostcommon area is the face (especially the skin, nose, hair, eyes, teeth, lips, chin or overall facialappearance).

However, both disorders may co-occur, and bothdiagnoses may be assigned if warranted.Boundary with social anxiety disorderIndividuals with olfactory reference disorder may avoid social situations specifically because theybelieve they are emitting a foul odour. In contrast, in social anxiety disorder, social situations areavoided because the individual is concerned that they will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms,that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e. be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejectionor be offensive)."

Ability to prepare food, use sinks or home appliances (e.g. refrigerator, stove,washing machine) or furniture (e.g. sofas, chairs, beds, tables) may also be compromised.• Individuals with hoarding disorder may experience a range of chronic medical problems,such as obesity, and are exposed to various environmental risks often caused by theirhoarding behaviour, including fire hazards, injuries from falling, contamination by rottingperishable foods, and allergies from contact with dust pollen and bacteria.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Collectors acquire many items that they report being attached to and are reluctant todiscard. However, they are also more targeted in their acquisitions (e.g. confining theiracquisitions to a narrow range of items), more selective (e.g. planning and purchasingonly predetermined items), more likely to organize their possessions, and less likely toaccumulate items in an excessive manner.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder 324 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCourse features• Hoarding behaviours often begin during childhood or adolescence, and persist into laterlife. Onset after the age of 40 years is rare.• Hoarding disorder is typically chronic and progressive.• The consequences of hoarding typically become more severe and impairing with age, owingto accumulation of objects over time and an increasing inability to discard or organizepossessions. Sometimes, this is due to the onset of comorbid medical conditions and co-occurring mental disorders.• Among older adults, hoarding disorder is associated with impairment in a range of lifedomains, including unsafe living conditions, social isolation, pathological self-neglect (i.e.poor hygiene), co-occurring mental disorders and medical comorbidities.Developmental presentations• Hoarding disorder has its onset in childhood and adolescence (between the ages of 11and 15 years) with prevalence rates reported as high as 2–3.7% by mid-adolescence. Laterlife onset may be a manifestation of the cognitive deficits and behavioural symptomsassociated with dementia (e.g. decreased inhibition or repetitive behaviour) rather thanhoarding disorder.• Excessive collecting and accumulation of clutter characteristic of hoarding disorder inadults may not be as evident among young people because caregivers may restrict excessiveacquisition of objects. As such, hoarding is more likely to be restricted to particular areas(such as a child’s bedroom) and types of materials (such as school-related objects, toys andfood) that the child can most easily access.• Collecting and saving items is developmentally appropriate behaviour for young childrenup to the age of 6 years, making it more challenging for parents and clinicians to differentiateproblematic hoarding from age-appropriate collecting and retaining objects.• Individuals with hoarding disorder are more likely to experience co-occurring mentaldisorders or comorbid medical conditions, though this varies across developmentalperiods. Children and adolescents with hoarding symptoms are more likely to have co-occurring mental disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or attention deficithyperactivity disorder. Hoarding symptoms are also more common among young peoplewith autism spectrum disorder or Prader-Willi syndrome. However, an additionaldiagnosis of hoarding disorder may be appropriate if the symptoms of each disorder requireindependent clinical attention. Among older adults with hoarding disorder, depressivedisorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are themost common co-occurring mental disorders.• Hoarding occurring later in life has also been correlated with decreased memory, attentionand executive functioning, although the increased rates of co-occurring disorders such asdementia and depressive disorders may also be involved.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 325Culture-related features• The nature of what is collected and the meaning, emotional valence and value that peoplewith hoarding disorder assign to their possessions may have cultural significance.• Cultural values of thriftiness and accumulation should not be mistaken as evidence ofdisorder. In some cultural environments, saving items for later use is encouraged. Thismay be especially true in contexts of scarcity or within groups who have experiencedprotracted periods of scarcity. Unless the symptoms are beyond what is expected of thecultural norms, these behaviours should not be assigned a diagnosis of hoarding disorder.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although prevalence rates for hoarding disorder are higher among women in clinicalsamples, some epidemiological studies have reported significantly higher prevalence ratesamong men.• Men with hoarding disorder are more likely to have co-occurring obsessive-compulsivedisorder.• Although the presenting features of hoarding disorder do not vary across genders, womentend to exhibit more excessive acquisition, particularly by means of compulsive buying.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderIndividuals affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder may accumulate excessive amountsof objects (i.e. compulsive hoarding). However, unlike hoarding disorder, the behaviour isundertaken with the goal of neutralizing or reducing concomitant distress and anxiety arisingfrom obsessional content such as aggressive (e.g. fear of harming others), sexual/religious (e.g.fear of committing blasphemous or disrespectful acts), contamination (e.g. fear of spreadinginfectious diseases) or symmetry/ordering (e.g. feeling of incompleteness) themes. Furthermore,even in individuals affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder who have poor or absent insight,the behaviour is generally unwanted and distressing, whereas in hoarding disorder it may beassociated with pleasure or enjoyment. However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnosticrequirements for each are met.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder 326 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with autism spectrum disorderAutism spectrum disorder is characterized by restricted interests that may result in objectaccumulation, and may also result in difficulty discarding objects due to distress associatedwith changes imposed on a familiar environment. However, individuals with autism spectrumdisorder display other symptoms that are typically lacking among individuals with hoardingdisorder, including persistent deficits in social communication and reciprocal social interactions.Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disordersIn schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, object accumulation may occur butis typically driven by delusions. Some individuals with hoarding disorder lack insight aboutthe irrationality of their thoughts and behaviours to such an extent that convictions of theimportance of acquiring and retaining items may at times appear to be delusional in the degree ofconviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (see insight specifiers, p. 322). If these beliefsare restricted to the fear of discarding items or conviction that items have a special importancedespite objective evidence to the contrary without a history of other delusions – that is, thesebeliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of hoarding disorder and are fullyconsistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – hoarding disorder should be diagnosedinstead of delusional disorder. Individuals with hoarding disorder do not exhibit other features ofpsychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).Boundary with mood disordersUnlike individuals with hoarding disorder, those with mood disorders may exhibit hoardingsecondary to depressive or manic symptomatology. In the case of depressive disorders,decreased energy, lack of initiative or apathy may lead to object accumulation, which – unlikehoarding disorder – is done without any intention or purpose. Furthermore, individuals withdepressive disorders may be indifferent to hoarding objects, and display no distress associatedwith discarding them. In the case of bipolar disorders, object accumulation may be secondary toexcessive buying that can occur during manic episodes. However, those with bipolar disorders donot have difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, and only very rarely are manic episodesof sufficient duration to allow for a substantial amount of clutter to develop in the home.Boundary with feeding and eating disordersSome individuals diagnosed with feeding and eating disorders may accumulate large quantitiesof food to allow for binge eating in specific situations (e.g. while at home alone). However, incontrast to hoarding disorder, the purpose of accumulation is restricted to the consumption offood. Concerns about being or becoming overweight and body-image distortions are not presentin hoarding disorder.Boundary with dementiaSome individuals with dementia accumulate objects as a result of progressive neurocognitivedeficit. Unlike hoarding disorder, individuals with dementia display little interest in accumulatingobjects or distress associated with discarding items. Furthermore, collecting behaviour indementia may be accompanied by severe personality and behavioural changes, such as apathy,sexual indiscretions and motor stereotyped movements.Boundary with Prader-Willi syndromePrader-Willi syndrome is associated with an increased drive to eat and a range of compulsivesymptoms, including food storing. The presence of short stature, hypogonadism, failure to thrive,hypotonia and a history of feeding difficulty in the neonatal period are helpful for the differentialdiagnosis with hoarding disorder.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 327","Hoarding disorder, unspecified","Hoarding disorder, unspecifiedAdditional clinical features• Assessment for the diagnosis of hoarding disorder may require obtaining additionalinformation beyond self-report, such as reports from collateral informants or visualinspection of clutter in the home.• Generally, items are hoarded because of their emotional significance (e.g. association witha significant event, person, place or time), instrumental characteristics (e.g. perceivedusefulness) or intrinsic value (e.g. perceived aesthetic qualities).• Individuals with hoarding disorder may be unable to find important items (e.g. bills,tax forms), circulate easily inside their home, or even exit their home in the event of anemergency.

However, they are also more targeted in their acquisitions (e.g. confining theiracquisitions to a narrow range of items), more selective (e.g. planning and purchasingonly predetermined items), more likely to organize their possessions, and less likely toaccumulate items in an excessive manner.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder 324 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCourse features• Hoarding behaviours often begin during childhood or adolescence, and persist into laterlife. Onset after the age of 40 years is rare.• Hoarding disorder is typically chronic and progressive.• The consequences of hoarding typically become more severe and impairing with age, owingto accumulation of objects over time and an increasing inability to discard or organizepossessions. Sometimes, this is due to the onset of comorbid medical conditions and co-occurring mental disorders.• Among older adults, hoarding disorder is associated with impairment in a range of lifedomains, including unsafe living conditions, social isolation, pathological self-neglect (i.e.poor hygiene), co-occurring mental disorders and medical comorbidities.Developmental presentations• Hoarding disorder has its onset in childhood and adolescence (between the ages of 11and 15 years) with prevalence rates reported as high as 2–3.7% by mid-adolescence. Laterlife onset may be a manifestation of the cognitive deficits and behavioural symptomsassociated with dementia (e.g. decreased inhibition or repetitive behaviour) rather thanhoarding disorder.• Excessive collecting and accumulation of clutter characteristic of hoarding disorder inadults may not be as evident among young people because caregivers may restrict excessiveacquisition of objects. As such, hoarding is more likely to be restricted to particular areas(such as a child’s bedroom) and types of materials (such as school-related objects, toys andfood) that the child can most easily access.• Collecting and saving items is developmentally appropriate behaviour for young childrenup to the age of 6 years, making it more challenging for parents and clinicians to differentiateproblematic hoarding from age-appropriate collecting and retaining objects.• Individuals with hoarding disorder are more likely to experience co-occurring mentaldisorders or comorbid medical conditions, though this varies across developmentalperiods. Children and adolescents with hoarding symptoms are more likely to have co-occurring mental disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or attention deficithyperactivity disorder. Hoarding symptoms are also more common among young peoplewith autism spectrum disorder or Prader-Willi syndrome. However, an additionaldiagnosis of hoarding disorder may be appropriate if the symptoms of each disorder requireindependent clinical attention. Among older adults with hoarding disorder, depressivedisorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are themost common co-occurring mental disorders.• Hoarding occurring later in life has also been correlated with decreased memory, attentionand executive functioning, although the increased rates of co-occurring disorders such asdementia and depressive disorders may also be involved.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 325Culture-related features• The nature of what is collected and the meaning, emotional valence and value that peoplewith hoarding disorder assign to their possessions may have cultural significance.• Cultural values of thriftiness and accumulation should not be mistaken as evidence ofdisorder. In some cultural environments, saving items for later use is encouraged. Thismay be especially true in contexts of scarcity or within groups who have experiencedprotracted periods of scarcity. Unless the symptoms are beyond what is expected of thecultural norms, these behaviours should not be assigned a diagnosis of hoarding disorder.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although prevalence rates for hoarding disorder are higher among women in clinicalsamples, some epidemiological studies have reported significantly higher prevalence ratesamong men.• Men with hoarding disorder are more likely to have co-occurring obsessive-compulsivedisorder.• Although the presenting features of hoarding disorder do not vary across genders, womentend to exhibit more excessive acquisition, particularly by means of compulsive buying.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderIndividuals affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder may accumulate excessive amountsof objects (i.e. compulsive hoarding). However, unlike hoarding disorder, the behaviour isundertaken with the goal of neutralizing or reducing concomitant distress and anxiety arisingfrom obsessional content such as aggressive (e.g. fear of harming others), sexual/religious (e.g.fear of committing blasphemous or disrespectful acts), contamination (e.g. fear of spreadinginfectious diseases) or symmetry/ordering (e.g. feeling of incompleteness) themes. Furthermore,even in individuals affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder who have poor or absent insight,the behaviour is generally unwanted and distressing, whereas in hoarding disorder it may beassociated with pleasure or enjoyment. However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnosticrequirements for each are met.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder 326 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with autism spectrum disorderAutism spectrum disorder is characterized by restricted interests that may result in objectaccumulation, and may also result in difficulty discarding objects due to distress associatedwith changes imposed on a familiar environment. However, individuals with autism spectrumdisorder display other symptoms that are typically lacking among individuals with hoardingdisorder, including persistent deficits in social communication and reciprocal social interactions.Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disordersIn schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, object accumulation may occur butis typically driven by delusions. Some individuals with hoarding disorder lack insight aboutthe irrationality of their thoughts and behaviours to such an extent that convictions of theimportance of acquiring and retaining items may at times appear to be delusional in the degree ofconviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (see insight specifiers, p. 322). If these beliefsare restricted to the fear of discarding items or conviction that items have a special importancedespite objective evidence to the contrary without a history of other delusions – that is, thesebeliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of hoarding disorder and are fullyconsistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – hoarding disorder should be diagnosedinstead of delusional disorder. Individuals with hoarding disorder do not exhibit other features ofpsychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).Boundary with mood disordersUnlike individuals with hoarding disorder, those with mood disorders may exhibit hoardingsecondary to depressive or manic symptomatology. In the case of depressive disorders,decreased energy, lack of initiative or apathy may lead to object accumulation, which – unlikehoarding disorder – is done without any intention or purpose. Furthermore, individuals withdepressive disorders may be indifferent to hoarding objects, and display no distress associatedwith discarding them. In the case of bipolar disorders, object accumulation may be secondary toexcessive buying that can occur during manic episodes. However, those with bipolar disorders donot have difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, and only very rarely are manic episodesof sufficient duration to allow for a substantial amount of clutter to develop in the home.Boundary with feeding and eating disordersSome individuals diagnosed with feeding and eating disorders may accumulate large quantitiesof food to allow for binge eating in specific situations (e.g. while at home alone). However, incontrast to hoarding disorder, the purpose of accumulation is restricted to the consumption offood. Concerns about being or becoming overweight and body-image distortions are not presentin hoarding disorder.Boundary with dementiaSome individuals with dementia accumulate objects as a result of progressive neurocognitivedeficit. Unlike hoarding disorder, individuals with dementia display little interest in accumulatingobjects or distress associated with discarding items. Furthermore, collecting behaviour indementia may be accompanied by severe personality and behavioural changes, such as apathy,sexual indiscretions and motor stereotyped movements.Boundary with Prader-Willi syndromePrader-Willi syndrome is associated with an increased drive to eat and a range of compulsivesymptoms, including food storing. The presence of short stature, hypogonadism, failure to thrive,hypotonia and a history of feeding difficulty in the neonatal period are helpful for the differentialdiagnosis with hoarding disorder.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 327"

Focused, intentional hair pulling – oftenpreceded by intense urges and followed by relief – is more common among adolescentsand adults.• The negative impact of hair pulling appears to become more severe across developmentalperiods. Children under the age of 10 years appear to experience less academic impact thanolder children and adolescents, who tend to report more difficulties in school attendanceand academic performance as a result of hair pulling.• As with adults, children and adolescents with trichotillomania appear to have high rates ofco-occurring mental health disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, other body-focused repetitivebehaviour disorders and depressive disorders.

Therefore, careful assessment includinginformation from collateral sources may be required to ascertain the presence of excoriationdisorder symptomatology.• Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of time on theirbehaviour – sometimes several hours each day. Skin picking may endure for months oryears before coming to clinical attention.• Excoriation disorder often presents with rituals surrounding the skin such as visually ortactilely examining the skin, orally manipulating or eating the skin or scab after it has beenpicked.• Skin-picking behaviour is associated with a variety of reported effects, including regulationof affect and arousal, tension reduction and promotion of pleasure, which presumablyreinforce these behaviours. However, in the aftermath of skin picking, many individualsreport a variety of negative affective states, such as a sense of loss of control or shame.Individuals with excoriation disorder report varying degrees of awareness of their skin-picking behaviour.• Excoriation disorder commonly co-occurs with trichotillomania.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Occasional picking of one’s skin (e.g. scabs, cuticles or acne) is normal and done by mostpeople at some time in their lives. Some individuals bite their cuticles or surroundingskin; these behaviours do not qualify for a diagnosis of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.Excoriation disorder involves recurrent picking and is associated with significant distressor impairment, which are not present in occasional, normal skin picking.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders 332 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCourse features• Onset of excoriation disorder can occur at any age, but most often coincides with onset orshortly after onset of puberty.• The onset commonly occurs in association with a dermatological condition, but the skinpicking persists after the dermatological condition resolves.• For some individuals, an urge to pick at their skin may be preceded by emotional triggerssuch as increasing feelings of anxiety and tension or boredom. Others may pick at theirskin in response to tactile sensitivity (i.e. skin irregularities) or bothersome skin sensations.In such cases, skin picking often results in an alleviation of tension, relief or a sense ofgratification.• Excoriation disorder is generally considered a chronic condition. Some individuals mayexperience a waxing and waning of symptoms over weeks, months or years at a time.Developmental presentations• Excoriation disorder most often has its onset during adolescence, typically correspondingto puberty. However, the emergence of symptoms can occur across the lifespan.• Childhood-onset excoriation disorder is more prevalent among females.• Automatic skin picking, which tends to occur unintentionally, outside awareness, appearsmore frequently among individuals with childhood-onset excoriation disorder. Skinpicking then appears to shift in adolescence and adulthood, as picking becomes focused.This picking appears to be generally intentional, connected to intense urges to pick, andoften results in a sense of relief.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Prevalence rates for excoriation disorder are significantly higher among women.• Men have an earlier age of onset for the disorder.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disordersRepetitive behaviours observed in excoriation disorder occur in other obsessive-compulsiveand related disorders, but these are typically related to specific foci of apprehension, and areObsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders 333associated with distinct intent for each diagnostic entity. Individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder may engage in skin-picking behaviour (e.g. when they experiencecontamination obsessions that are associated with behaviours intended to pick the skin to removecontamination). Obsessions do not precede skin picking in excoriation disorder, and individualswith obsessive-compulsive disorder often exhibit other compulsions that are unrelated to skinpicking. Nonetheless, co-occurrence with obsessive-compulsive disorder is common, and bothdisorders may be diagnosed if warranted. Body dysmorphic disorder may be associated withpicking as a means of improving the individual’s appearance by removing acne or other perceivedblemishes of the skin that the individual believes are ugly or that appear abnormal. Individualswith excoriation disorder do not pick skin with the sole purpose of correcting a perceived defectin appearance.Boundary with stereotyped movement disorderStereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months)presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmicmovements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting).These behaviours rarely include skin-picking behaviour, but if they do, the behaviour tendsto be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable. Furthermore,stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (i.e. before 2 years of age),whereas excoriation disorder typically has a later onset.Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disordersIndividuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may pick at their skin inresponse to a delusion or hallucination. Individuals with excoriation disorder do not report skinpicking secondary to delusions or hallucinations.Boundary with Prader-Willi syndromeIndividuals with Prader-Willi syndrome may have early onset of skin picking more consistentwith a stereotyped movement disorder. Prader-Willi syndrome is usually associated with aconstellation of other symptoms, such as mild to moderate disorder of intellectual development,neonatal and infantile hypotonia, feeding problems and poor weight gain in infancy, followed byhyperphagia and morbid obesity in childhood.Boundary with medical conditions classified elsewhere and disorders due tosubstance useThe symptoms of excoriation disorder are not a manifestation of another medical condition(e.g. scabies). However, skin picking may emerge following or be worsened by the presence ofanother condition (e.g. acne), and a diagnosis of excoriation disorder may be applied in thiscircumstance if diagnostic requirements are met. Skin picking may also result from the use ormisuse of stimulants (e.g. cocaine, methamfetamine, prescription stimulants), but excoriationdisorder should not be diagnosed if the skin picking occurs exclusively in this context.Boundary with self-injurious and self-mutilating behavioursUnlike self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviours, skin-picking behaviours characteristic ofexcoriation disorder are not performed with the express purpose of self-injury, although suchinjury may occur as a result.Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders 334 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders"

151,6B40,Post traumatic stress disorder,"Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations~ 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s)~ and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for example as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.",Traumatic neurosis,Acute stress reaction; Complex post traumatic stress disorder,"Post-traumatic stress disorderEssential (required) features• Exposure to an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threateningor horrific nature is required for diagnosis. Such events include, but are not limited to,directly experiencing natural or human-made disasters, combat, serious accidents, torture,sexual violence, terrorism, assault or acute life-threatening illness (e.g. a heart attack);witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected orviolent manner; and learning about the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one.• Following the traumatic event or situation, the development of a characteristic syndromelasting for at least several weeks consists of all three of the following core elements.• The traumatic event is re-experienced in the present: it is not just remembered but isexperienced as occurring again in the here and now. This typically occurs in the formof vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is atransient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a completeloss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that arethematically related to the traumatic event. Re-experiencing is typically accompanied bystrong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations.Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed orimmersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumaticevent, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to remindersof the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event and remembering the feelingsexperienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement.• Reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event are deliberatelyavoided. Deliberate avoidance may take the form either of active internal avoidanceof thoughts and memories related to the event, or external avoidance of people,conversations, activities or situations reminiscent of the event. In extreme cases, theperson may change their environment (e.g. move to a different city or change jobs) toavoid reminders.• There are persistent perceptions of heightened current threat – for example, as indicatedby hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises.Hypervigilant people constantly guard themselves against danger, and feel themselvesor others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or moregenerally. They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g. not sitting withtheir back to the door, repeatedly checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirrors).• The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it isonly through significant additional effort.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder 340 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• Common symptomatic presentations of post-traumatic stress disorder may also includegeneral dysphoria, dissociative symptoms, somatic complaints, suicidal ideation andbehaviour, social withdrawal, excessive alcohol or drug use to avoid re-experiencingor manage emotional reactions, anxiety symptoms including panic, and obsessions orcompulsions in response to memories or reminders of the trauma.• The emotional experience of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder commonlyincludes anger, shame, sadness, humiliation or guilt, including survivor guilt.Boundary with normality (threshold)• A history of exposure to an event or situation of an extremely threatening or horrificnature does not in itself indicate the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Manypeople experience such stressors without developing a disorder. Rather, the presentationmust meet all diagnostic requirements for the disorder.Course features• Onset of post-traumatic stress disorder can occur at any time during the lifespan followingexposure to a traumatic event.• Onset of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms typically occurs within 3 monthsfollowing exposure to a traumatic event. However, delays in the expression of post-traumaticstress disorder symptomology can occur even years after exposure to a traumatic event.• The symptoms and course of post-traumatic stress disorder can vary significantly overtime and among individuals. Recurrence of symptoms may occur after to exposure toreminders of the traumatic event or as a result of experiencing additional life stressorsor traumatic events. Some individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder canexperience persistent symptoms for months or years without reprieve.• Nearly half of individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder will experiencecomplete recovery of symptoms within 3 months of onset.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 341Developmental presentations• Post-traumatic stress disorder can occur at all ages, but responses to a traumatic event – thatis, the core elements of the characteristic syndrome – can manifest differently dependingon age and developmental stage.• Emerging cognitive capacities and limited verbal abilities for self-reporting in youngchildren (e.g. under 6 years of age) make it more difficult to assess for the presence of re-experiencing, active avoidance of internal states and perceptions of heightened currentthreat. Assessments of symptoms should not be based exclusively on child-reportedinternal symptoms, but should include caregiver reports of observable behaviouralsymptoms emerging after traumatic experiences.• In younger children, evidence of the core symptoms supporting a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder often manifests behaviourally, such as in trauma-specificre-enactments that may occur during repetitive play or in drawings, frightening dreamswithout clear content or night terrors, or uncharacteristic impulsivity. However, childrenmay not necessarily appear distressed when talking about or playing out their traumaticrecollections, despite substantial impact on psychosocial functioning and development.Other manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder in preschool-aged children may beless trauma-specific and include both inhibited and disinhibited behaviours. For example,hypervigilance may manifest as increased frequency and intensity of temper tantrums,separation anxiety, regression in skills (e.g. verbal skills, toileting), exaggerated age-associated fears or excessive crying. External avoidance or expressions of recollection oftraumatic experiences may be evidenced by a new onset of acting out, protective or rescuestrategies, limited exploration or reluctance to engage in new activities, and excessivereassurance-seeking from a trusted caregiver.• Limited capacity to reflect on and report internal states may also be characteristic of someschool-aged children and adolescents. Furthermore, children and adolescents may bemore reluctant than adults to report their reactions to traumatic events. In such cases,greater reliance on changes in behaviour such as increased trauma-specific re-enactmentsor overt avoidance may be necessary.• Children or adolescents may deny feelings of distress or horror associated with re-experiencing, and rather report no affect or other types of strong or overwhelmingemotions as a part of re-experiencing, including those that are non-distressing.• In adolescence, reluctance to pursue developmental opportunities (e.g. to gainautonomy from caregivers) may be a sign of psychosocial impairment. Self-injurious orrisky behaviours (e.g. substance use or unprotected sex) occur at elevated rates amongadolescents and adults with post-traumatic stress disorder.• Assessment can be complicated in children and adolescents when loss of a parent orcaregiver is associated with a traumatic event or an intervention. For example, a chronicallyabused child who is removed from the home may place greater emphasis on the loss of aprimary caregiver than on aspects of the experience that might objectively be consideredmore threatening or horrific.• Among older adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, symptom severity may declineover the life-course – especially re-experiencing. However, avoidance of situations, people,activities or conversations about the event, as well as hypervigilance, typically persist.Older people may dismiss their symptoms as a normal part of life, which may be related toshame and fear of stigma.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder 342 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• The salience of particular post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may vary acrosscultures. For example, in some groups anger may be the most prominent symptom relatedto traumatic exposure, and the most culturally appropriate way of expressing distress. Inother cultural contexts, nightmares may have elaborate cultural significance that increasestheir importance in assessing for the characteristic symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder.• Symptoms central to post-traumatic stress disorder in some cultures may not be includedin descriptions of the disorder, and may therefore be missed by clinicians unfamiliar withthose cultural expressions. For example, somatic symptoms such as headaches (often withvisual aura), dizziness, bodily heat, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal distress, tremblingand orthostatic hypotension may be prominent.• Cultural variation may affect post-traumatic stress disorder onset and the meaning oftraumatic stressors. For example, some cultural groups attribute greater risk of post-traumatic stress disorder to traumatic events affecting family members than those affectingthe person themselves; other societies may find it particularly traumatic to observe thedesecration or destruction of religious symbols or to be denied the ability to performfuneral rites for deceased relatives.• Certain trauma-related symptoms may be associated with intense fear in particularcultural contexts owing to their connection with specific catastrophic cognitions, and mayprecipitate panic attacks in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder. These catastrophicinterpretations may affect the trajectory of the disorder, and may be associated with greaterseverity, chronicity or poorer response to treatment. For example, some Latin Americanpatients may consider trauma-related trembling to be the precursor of a lifelong conditionof severe nervios (nerves), and some Cambodians may interpret palpitations as signs of aweak heart.• Some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may not be viewed as pathological insome cultural groups. For example, intrusive thoughts may be considered normal ratherthan a symptom indicating illness. It is important to evaluate the presence of all requireddiagnostic elements, including functional impairment, rather than treating any onesymptom as pathognomic.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Post-traumatic stress disorder is more common among females.• Females diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to experience alonger duration of impairment and higher levels of negative emotionality and somaticsymptoms as a part of their clinical presentation.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 343Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with complex post-traumatic stress disorderWhereas the diagnostic requirements for complex post-traumatic stress disorder include allessential features of post-traumatic stress disorder, the diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stressdisorder also requires the additional essential features of severe problems in affect regulation,persistent negative beliefs about oneself, and persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships.Boundary with prolonged grief disorderAs with post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder may occur in individuals whoexperience bereavement as a result of the death of a loved one occurring in traumatic circumstances.In post-traumatic stress disorder the individual re-experiences the event or situation associatedwith the death, while in prolonged grief disorder the person may be preoccupied with memoriesof the circumstances surrounding the death but, unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, does notre-experience them as occurring again in the here and now.Boundary with adjustment disorderIn adjustment disorder, the stressor can be of any severity or any type, and is not necessarily ofan extremely threatening or horrific nature. A response to a less serious event or situation thatotherwise meets the symptom requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder but that is beyondthe duration appropriate for acute stress reaction should be diagnosed as adjustment disorder.Moreover, many people who experience an extremely threatening or horrific event developsymptoms that do not meet the full diagnostic requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder;these reactions are generally better diagnosed as adjustment disorder.Boundary with acute stress reactionNormal acute reactions to traumatic events can include all the symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder, including re-experiencing, but these begin to subside fairly quickly (e.g. within 1 weekafter the event terminates or after removal from the threatening situation, or within 1 month inthe case of ongoing stressors). If clinical intervention is warranted in these situations, a diagnosisof acute stress reaction from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with healthservices (i.e. a non-disorder category) is generally most appropriate.Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disordersSome individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder re-experience traumatic events in the formof severe flashbacks that may have a hallucinatory quality, or are hypervigilant to threat to theextent that they may appear to be paranoid. Auditory pseudo-hallucinations, recognized as beingthe person’s own thoughts and of internal origin, can occur in post-traumatic stress disorder.Such symptoms should not be considered evidence of a psychotic disorder.Boundary with depressive episodeIn a depressive episode, intrusive memories are not experienced as occurring again in the present,but as belonging to the past, and they are often accompanied by rumination. However, depressiveepisodes commonly co-occur with post-traumatic stress disorder, and an additional mooddisorder diagnosis should be assigned if warranted.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder 344 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with panic disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks can be triggered by reminders of the traumaticevent or in the context of re-experiencing. Panic attacks that occur entirely in these contexts donot warrant an additional, separate diagnosis of panic disorder. Instead, the with panic attacksspecifier (MB23.H) may be applied together with the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis.However, if unexpected panic attacks (i.e. those that come on out of the blue) are also presentand the other diagnostic requirements are met, an additional diagnosis of panic disorderis appropriate.Boundary with specific phobiaIn some cases, a situational or conditioned specific phobia can arise after exposure to a traumaticevent (e.g. being attacked by a dog). Specific phobia can generally be differentiated from post-traumatic stress disorder by the absence of re-experiencing of the event in the present. Althoughphobic responses may include powerful memories of the event, in response to which the individualexperiences anxiety, the memories are experienced as belonging to the past.Boundary with dissociative disordersFollowing an experience of a traumatic event, a variety of dissociative symptoms can occur,including somatic symptoms, memory disturbances, flashbacks or other trance-like states,alterations in identity and sense of agency, and experiences of depersonalization, especiallyduring the episodes of re-experiencing. If the dissociative symptoms are confined to episodes ofre-experiencing in an individual with post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumaticstress disorder, an additional diagnosis of a dissociative disorder should not be assigned.If significant dissociative symptoms are present outside episodes of re-experiencing, and the fulldiagnostic requirements are met, an additional dissociative disorder diagnosis may be assigned.Boundary with other mental disordersIt is common for mental disorders other than or in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder todevelop in the aftermath of an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremelythreatening or horrific nature. Thus, a history of exposure to a potentially traumatic event doesnot in itself indicate the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Depressive disorders, anxietyand fear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and dissociative disorders can all occurin the aftermath of potentially traumatic experiences, often in the absence of post-traumaticstress disorder.",Post traumatic stress disorder,"Disorder Name: Post traumatic stress disorderDisorder Code: 6B40Disorder symptoms: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events.

External avoidance or expressions of recollection oftraumatic experiences may be evidenced by a new onset of acting out, protective or rescuestrategies, limited exploration or reluctance to engage in new activities, and excessivereassurance-seeking from a trusted caregiver.• Limited capacity to reflect on and report internal states may also be characteristic of someschool-aged children and adolescents. Furthermore, children and adolescents may bemore reluctant than adults to report their reactions to traumatic events. In such cases,greater reliance on changes in behaviour such as increased trauma-specific re-enactmentsor overt avoidance may be necessary.• Children or adolescents may deny feelings of distress or horror associated with re-experiencing, and rather report no affect or other types of strong or overwhelmingemotions as a part of re-experiencing, including those that are non-distressing.• In adolescence, reluctance to pursue developmental opportunities (e.g. to gainautonomy from caregivers) may be a sign of psychosocial impairment. Self-injurious orrisky behaviours (e.g. substance use or unprotected sex) occur at elevated rates amongadolescents and adults with post-traumatic stress disorder.• Assessment can be complicated in children and adolescents when loss of a parent orcaregiver is associated with a traumatic event or an intervention. For example, a chronicallyabused child who is removed from the home may place greater emphasis on the loss of aprimary caregiver than on aspects of the experience that might objectively be consideredmore threatening or horrific.• Among older adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, symptom severity may declineover the life-course – especially re-experiencing. However, avoidance of situations, people,activities or conversations about the event, as well as hypervigilance, typically persist.Older people may dismiss their symptoms as a normal part of life, which may be related toshame and fear of stigma.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder 342 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features• The salience of particular post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may vary acrosscultures. For example, in some groups anger may be the most prominent symptom relatedto traumatic exposure, and the most culturally appropriate way of expressing distress. Inother cultural contexts, nightmares may have elaborate cultural significance that increasestheir importance in assessing for the characteristic symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder.• Symptoms central to post-traumatic stress disorder in some cultures may not be includedin descriptions of the disorder, and may therefore be missed by clinicians unfamiliar withthose cultural expressions. For example, somatic symptoms such as headaches (often withvisual aura), dizziness, bodily heat, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal distress, tremblingand orthostatic hypotension may be prominent.• Cultural variation may affect post-traumatic stress disorder onset and the meaning oftraumatic stressors. For example, some cultural groups attribute greater risk of post-traumatic stress disorder to traumatic events affecting family members than those affectingthe person themselves; other societies may find it particularly traumatic to observe thedesecration or destruction of religious symbols or to be denied the ability to performfuneral rites for deceased relatives.• Certain trauma-related symptoms may be associated with intense fear in particularcultural contexts owing to their connection with specific catastrophic cognitions, and mayprecipitate panic attacks in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder. These catastrophicinterpretations may affect the trajectory of the disorder, and may be associated with greaterseverity, chronicity or poorer response to treatment. For example, some Latin Americanpatients may consider trauma-related trembling to be the precursor of a lifelong conditionof severe nervios (nerves), and some Cambodians may interpret palpitations as signs of aweak heart.• Some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may not be viewed as pathological insome cultural groups. For example, intrusive thoughts may be considered normal ratherthan a symptom indicating illness. It is important to evaluate the presence of all requireddiagnostic elements, including functional impairment, rather than treating any onesymptom as pathognomic.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Post-traumatic stress disorder is more common among females.• Females diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to experience alonger duration of impairment and higher levels of negative emotionality and somaticsymptoms as a part of their clinical presentation.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 343Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with complex post-traumatic stress disorderWhereas the diagnostic requirements for complex post-traumatic stress disorder include allessential features of post-traumatic stress disorder, the diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stressdisorder also requires the additional essential features of severe problems in affect regulation,persistent negative beliefs about oneself, and persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships.Boundary with prolonged grief disorderAs with post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder may occur in individuals whoexperience bereavement as a result of the death of a loved one occurring in traumatic circumstances.In post-traumatic stress disorder the individual re-experiences the event or situation associatedwith the death, while in prolonged grief disorder the person may be preoccupied with memoriesof the circumstances surrounding the death but, unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, does notre-experience them as occurring again in the here and now.Boundary with adjustment disorderIn adjustment disorder, the stressor can be of any severity or any type, and is not necessarily ofan extremely threatening or horrific nature. A response to a less serious event or situation thatotherwise meets the symptom requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder but that is beyondthe duration appropriate for acute stress reaction should be diagnosed as adjustment disorder.Moreover, many people who experience an extremely threatening or horrific event developsymptoms that do not meet the full diagnostic requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder;these reactions are generally better diagnosed as adjustment disorder.Boundary with acute stress reactionNormal acute reactions to traumatic events can include all the symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder, including re-experiencing, but these begin to subside fairly quickly (e.g. within 1 weekafter the event terminates or after removal from the threatening situation, or within 1 month inthe case of ongoing stressors). If clinical intervention is warranted in these situations, a diagnosisof acute stress reaction from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with healthservices (i.e. a non-disorder category) is generally most appropriate.Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disordersSome individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder re-experience traumatic events in the formof severe flashbacks that may have a hallucinatory quality, or are hypervigilant to threat to theextent that they may appear to be paranoid. Auditory pseudo-hallucinations, recognized as beingthe person’s own thoughts and of internal origin, can occur in post-traumatic stress disorder.Such symptoms should not be considered evidence of a psychotic disorder.Boundary with depressive episodeIn a depressive episode, intrusive memories are not experienced as occurring again in the present,but as belonging to the past, and they are often accompanied by rumination. However, depressiveepisodes commonly co-occur with post-traumatic stress disorder, and an additional mooddisorder diagnosis should be assigned if warranted.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder 344 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with panic disorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks can be triggered by reminders of the traumaticevent or in the context of re-experiencing. Panic attacks that occur entirely in these contexts donot warrant an additional, separate diagnosis of panic disorder. Instead, the with panic attacksspecifier (MB23.H) may be applied together with the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis.However, if unexpected panic attacks (i.e. those that come on out of the blue) are also presentand the other diagnostic requirements are met, an additional diagnosis of panic disorderis appropriate.Boundary with specific phobiaIn some cases, a situational or conditioned specific phobia can arise after exposure to a traumaticevent (e.g. being attacked by a dog). Specific phobia can generally be differentiated from post-traumatic stress disorder by the absence of re-experiencing of the event in the present. Althoughphobic responses may include powerful memories of the event, in response to which the individualexperiences anxiety, the memories are experienced as belonging to the past.Boundary with dissociative disordersFollowing an experience of a traumatic event, a variety of dissociative symptoms can occur,including somatic symptoms, memory disturbances, flashbacks or other trance-like states,alterations in identity and sense of agency, and experiences of depersonalization, especiallyduring the episodes of re-experiencing. If the dissociative symptoms are confined to episodes ofre-experiencing in an individual with post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumaticstress disorder, an additional diagnosis of a dissociative disorder should not be assigned.If significant dissociative symptoms are present outside episodes of re-experiencing, and the fulldiagnostic requirements are met, an additional dissociative disorder diagnosis may be assigned.Boundary with other mental disordersIt is common for mental disorders other than or in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder todevelop in the aftermath of an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremelythreatening or horrific nature. Thus, a history of exposure to a potentially traumatic event doesnot in itself indicate the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Depressive disorders, anxietyand fear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and dissociative disorders can all occurin the aftermath of potentially traumatic experiences, often in the absence of post-traumaticstress disorder."
152,6B41,Complex post traumatic stress disorder,"Complex post traumatic stress disorder (Complex PTSD) is a disorder that may develop following exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g. torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse). All diagnostic requirements for PTSD are met. In addition, Complex PTSD is characterised by severe and persistent 1) problems in affect regulation~ 2) beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the traumatic event~ and 3) difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. These symptoms cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.",,Post traumatic stress disorder; Personality disorder,"Complex post-traumatic stress disorderEssential (required) features• Exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature – mostcommonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible – isrequired for diagnosis.

This typically occurs in the formof vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is atransient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a completeloss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that arethematically related to the traumatic event. Re-experiencing is typically accompanied bystrong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations.Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed orimmersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumaticevent, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to remindersof the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event and remembering the feelingsexperienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement.• Reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event are deliberatelyavoided. Deliberate avoidance may take the form either of active internal avoidance ofthoughts and memories related to the event, or external avoidance of people, conversations,activities or situations reminiscent of the event. In extreme cases, the person may changetheir environment (e.g. move house or change jobs) to avoid reminders.• There are persistent perceptions of heightened current threat – for example, as indicatedby hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises.Hypervigilant people constantly guard themselves against danger, and feel themselvesor others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or moregenerally. They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g. not sitting withtheir back to the door, repeatedly checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirrors). In complexpost-traumatic stress disorder, unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, the startle reactionmay in some cases be diminished rather than enhanced.• The presentation is characterized by severe and pervasive problems in affect regulation.Examples include heightened emotional reactivity to minor stressors, violent outbursts,reckless or self-destructive behaviour, dissociative symptoms when under stress, andemotional numbing – particularly the inability to experience pleasure or positive emotions.• Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless are accompanied bydeep and pervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the stressor. For example,the individual may feel guilty about not having escaped from or succumbing to the adversecircumstance, or not having been able to prevent the suffering of others.• Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others are present.The individual may consistently avoid, deride or have little interest in relationshipsand social engagement more generally. Alternatively, there may be occasional intenserelationships, but the individual has difficulty sustaining them.• The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning.

Many people experience such stressors without developing anydisorder. Rather, the presentation must meet all diagnostic requirements for the disorder.Course features• The onset of complex post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms can occur across the lifespan– typically after exposure to chronic, repeated traumatic events and/or victimization thathave continued for a period of months or years at a time.• Symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder are generally more severe andpersistent in comparison to those of post-traumatic stress disorder.• Exposure to repeated traumas, especially in early development, is associated with a greaterrisk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder rather than post-traumaticstress disorder.Developmental presentations• Complex post-traumatic stress disorder can occur at all ages, but responses to a traumaticevent – that is, the core elements of the characteristic syndrome – can manifest differentlydepending on age and developmental stage. Because complex post-traumatic stressdisorder and post-traumatic stress disorder share these same core elements, informationprovided in the developmental presentations section for post-traumatic stress disorder alsoapplies to children and adolescents affected by complex post-traumatic stress disorder.• Children and adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder when exposed to severe, prolonged trauma such as chronic childabuse, participation in drug trafficking or being used as child soldiers. Many children andadolescents exposed to trauma have been exposed to multiple traumas, which increasesthe risk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Complex post-traumatic stress disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 347• Children and adolescents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely thantheir peers to demonstrate cognitive difficulties (e.g. problems with attention, planning,organizing) that may in turn interfere with academic and occupational functioning.• In children, pervasive problems of affect regulation and persistent difficulties in sustainingrelationships may manifest as regression, reckless behaviour or aggressive behaviourstowards themselves or others, and in difficulties relating to peers. Furthermore, problemsof affect regulation may manifest as dissociation, suppression of emotional experience andexpression, and avoidance of situations or experiences that may elicit emotions, includingpositive emotions.• In adolescence, substance use, risk-taking behaviours (e.g. unsafe sex, unsafe driving, non-suicidal self-harm) and aggressive behaviours may be particularly evident as expressions ofproblems of affect dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties.• When parents or caregivers are the source of the trauma (e.g. sexual abuse), childrenand adolescents often develop a disorganized attachment style that can manifest asunpredictable behaviours towards these individuals (e.g. alternating between neediness,rejection and aggression). In children under 5 years of age, attachment disturbances relatedto maltreatment may also include reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited socialengagement disorder, which can co-occur with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.• Children and adolescents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder often reportsymptoms consistent with depressive disorders, eating and feeding disorders, sleep-wake disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder,conduct-dissocial disorder and separation anxiety disorder. The relationship of traumaticexperiences to the onset of symptoms can be useful in establishing a differential diagnosis.At the same time, other mental disorders can also develop following extremely stressfulor traumatic experiences. Additional co-occurring diagnoses should only be made if thesymptoms are not fully accounted for by complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and alldiagnostic requirements for each disorder are met.• In older adults, complex post-traumatic stress disorder may be dominated by anxiousavoidance of thoughts, feelings, memories and people, as well as physiological symptoms ofanxiety (e.g. enhanced startle reaction, autonomic hyper-reactivity). Affected individualsmay experience intense regret related to the impact of traumatic experiences on their lives.Culture-related features• Cultural variation exists in the expression of symptoms of complex post-traumatic stressdisorder. For example, somatic or dissociative symptoms may be more prominent incertain groups, attributable to cultural interpretations of the psychological, physiologicaland spiritual etiology of these symptoms and of high levels of arousal.• Given the severe, prolonged or recurrent nature of the traumatic events that precipitatecomplex post-traumatic stress disorder, collective suffering and the destruction of socialbonds, networks and communities may present as a focal concern or as important relatedfeatures of the disorder.• For migrant communities – especially refugees or asylum seekers – complex post-traumaticstress disorder may be exacerbated by acculturative stressors and the social environmentin the host country.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Complex post-traumatic stress disorder 348 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersSex- and/or gender-related features• Females are at greater risk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder.• Females with complex post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to exhibit a greaterlevel of psychological distress and functional impairment.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with personality disorderMany individuals with personality disorder have a history of traumatic events, particularly inchildhood, and affective dysregulation can be a feature of both complex PTSD and personalitydisorder, particularly personality disorder with borderline pattern. However, there are severalways in which the specific symptom profiles of the two disorders differ. Avoidance of trauma-related reminders and a heightened sense of current threat are not diagnostic features ofpersonality disorders. Intimate and interpersonal relationships in complex PTSD are less likelyto be characterized by fear of abandonment and relationship instability, but rather by avoidanceand a general sense of disconnection. Individuals with complex PTSD tend to manifest a stablebut persistently negative self-view, in contrast to personality disorder in which an unstable senseof self is more common. Whereas personality disorder is more likely to be characterized byfrequent impulsive behaviors, including impulsive suicidality, suicidality among individuals withcomplex PTSD tends to be less frequent, less impulsive, and of higher lethality. If the diagnosticrequirements for both disorders are met, the utility of assigning an additional diagnosis ofpersonality disorder depends on the specific clinical situation.Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disordersBecause the diagnostic requirements for complex post-traumatic stress disorder include allessential features of post-traumatic stress disorder, guidance provided in the sections onboundary with normality (threshold) and boundaries with other disorders and conditions(differential diagnosis) for post-traumatic stress disorder also applies to complex post-traumaticstress disorder.",Complex post traumatic stress disorder,"Disorder Name: Complex post traumatic stress disorderDisorder Code: 6B41Disorder symptoms: Complex post traumatic stress disorder (Complex PTSD) is a disorder that may develop following exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g. torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse).

153,6B42,Prolonged grief disorder,"Prolonged grief disorder is a disturbance in which, following the death of a partner, parent, child, or other person close to the bereaved, there is persistent and pervasive grief response characterised by longing for the deceased or persistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness, guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self, an inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social or other activities). The grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following the loss (more than 6 months at a minimum) and clearly exceeds expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s culture and context. Grief reactions that have persisted for longer periods that are within a normative period of grieving given the person’s cultural and religious context are viewed as normal bereavement responses and are not assigned a diagnosis.

Grief responses lasting for less than 6 months, and for longer periodsin some cultural contexts, should not be regarded as meeting this requirement.• The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational,occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it isonly through significant additional effort.Additional clinical features• Persistent preoccupation may focus on the circumstances of the death, or manifest asbehaviours such as the preservation of all the deceased person’s belongings exactly as theywere before their death. The individual may alternate between excessive preoccupationand avoidance of reminders of the deceased.• Other features of prolonged grief disorder may include problems coping without the lovedone, difficulties in recalling positive memories of the deceased, difficulty trusting others,social withdrawal and the feeling that life is meaningless.• Increased tobacco, alcohol and other substance use, as well as increased suicidal ideationand behaviour, may be present.Boundary with normality (threshold)• An individual experiencing a grief reaction that is within a normative period given theircultural and religious context is considered to be experiencing normal bereavement,and should not be assigned a diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder. It is often importantto consider whether other people who share the bereaved person’s cultural or religiousperspective (e.g. family, friends, community) regard the response to the loss or duration ofthe reaction as abnormal.• Children and adolescents may respond to the loss of a primary attachment figure (e.g. aparent or caregiver) with an intense and sustained grief response (e.g. greater in intensity,symptomatology, duration) because of the role these individuals play in the child’s life.Preschool-aged children commonly have difficulty accepting the loss. Aspects of the griefresponse may be retriggered at various points during the individual’s development – forexample, as new needs arise that would normally be supplied by the parent or caregiver.Generally, these reactions should be regarded as normal, and the diagnosis of prolongedgrief disorder should be assigned with caution to children and adolescents in this situation.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Prolonged grief disorder 350 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersDevelopmental presentations• Prolonged grief disorder can occur at all ages, but the grief response can differ dependingon the age and developmental stage, and thus on age-specific concepts of death.• Children often do not explicitly describe the experience of longing for the deceased orpersistent preoccupation with the death of a loved one. These symptoms may be morelikely to manifest behaviourally, such as in play or in other behaviours involving themes ofseparation or death. Other behavioural expressions of longing can include waiting for thedeceased person to return or returning to places where they last saw the deceased. Somechildren may develop a fearful preoccupation that others may die, or separation anxietycentring on worries about their caregivers’ welfare and safety.• In younger children, intense sadness or emotional pain may emerge intermittently withseemingly appropriate moods. Anger related to the loss may be exhibited in childrenand adolescents as irritability, protest behaviour, tantrums, oppositional behaviour orconduct problems.• Various contextual factors can influence symptoms related to the death of a loved one inchildren.

Even when an adequate primary caregiver is newly available, the child does not turn to the primary caregiver for comfort, support and nurture, rarely displays security-seeking behaviours towards any adult, and does not respond when comfort is offered. Reactive attachment disorder can only be diagnosed in children, and features of the disorder develop within the first 5 years of life.

Reactiveattachment disorder is associated with persistent neglect rather than isolated incidents.• Reactive attachment disorder may also be associated with persistent maltreatment,characterized by one or more of the following:• non-accidental acts of physical force that result – or have reasonable potential toresult – in physical harm, or that evoke significant fear;• sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult;• non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts that result in significant psychological harm.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Reactive attachment disorder 356 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Children with reactive attachment disorder related to repetitive maltreatment (e.g. chronicphysical or sexual abuse) are at risk of developing co-occurring post-traumatic stressdisorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder.• Children with reactive attachment disorder often exhibit more generalized persistentsocial and emotional disturbances, including a relative lack of social and emotionalresponsiveness to others and limited positive affect. There may be episodes of unexplainedirritability, sadness or fearfulness that are evident during non-threatening interactionswith adult caregivers.• Children with a history of grossly insufficient care but who have nonetheless formedselective attachments do not appear to develop reactive attachment disorder, but they maystill be at risk of developing disinhibited social engagement disorder.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Many children without a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder show transientreductions of attachment behaviours towards a parent or caregiver as a normal part ofdevelopment. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder exhibit markedlyatypical social responses towards caregivers that persist over time, extend across all socialsituations, and are not confined to a dyadic relationship with a particular caregiver.Course features• With the provision of adequate care, children with reactive attachment disorder oftenexperience a near or complete remission of symptoms. If appropriate caregiving is notprovided, the disorder can persist for several years.• Children with reactive attachment disorder are at higher risk of developing depressivedisorders and other internalizing disorders during adolescence and adulthood.

Although some children with reactive attachment disorder may show delays inlanguage development due to a history of social neglect, they do not exhibit social communicationdeficits or the persistently restrictive, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests andactivities characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. Some individuals reared under conditionsof severe deprivation in institutional settings exhibit autistic-like features, including difficultiesin social reciprocity and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests oractivities.

Attachments usually develop consistent with the child’s general developmental level,and are typically evident by the time the child has reached a developmental age of at least 9months. Reactive attachment disorder should only be diagnosed if it is clear that the characteristicproblems in the formation of selective attachments are not a result of limitations in intellectualfunctioning.Boundary with social anxiety disorderSocial anxiety disorder in children may include emotionally withdrawn behaviours in socialsituations, or in anticipation of social encounters, due to marked and excessive fear or anxiety.Unlike in reactive attachment disorder, children with social anxiety disorder exhibit appropriateattachment behaviours with parents or caregivers, and seek comfort from them when distressed,but are typically fearful of unfamiliar individuals.

Reactiveattachment disorder is associated with persistent neglect rather than isolated incidents.• Reactive attachment disorder may also be associated with persistent maltreatment,characterized by one or more of the following:• non-accidental acts of physical force that result – or have reasonable potential toresult – in physical harm, or that evoke significant fear;• sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult;• non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts that result in significant psychological harm.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Reactive attachment disorder 356 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Children with reactive attachment disorder related to repetitive maltreatment (e.g. chronicphysical or sexual abuse) are at risk of developing co-occurring post-traumatic stressdisorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder.• Children with reactive attachment disorder often exhibit more generalized persistentsocial and emotional disturbances, including a relative lack of social and emotionalresponsiveness to others and limited positive affect. There may be episodes of unexplainedirritability, sadness or fearfulness that are evident during non-threatening interactionswith adult caregivers.• Children with a history of grossly insufficient care but who have nonetheless formedselective attachments do not appear to develop reactive attachment disorder, but they maystill be at risk of developing disinhibited social engagement disorder.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Many children without a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder show transientreductions of attachment behaviours towards a parent or caregiver as a normal part ofdevelopment. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder exhibit markedlyatypical social responses towards caregivers that persist over time, extend across all socialsituations, and are not confined to a dyadic relationship with a particular caregiver.Course features• With the provision of adequate care, children with reactive attachment disorder oftenexperience a near or complete remission of symptoms. If appropriate caregiving is notprovided, the disorder can persist for several years.• Children with reactive attachment disorder are at higher risk of developing depressivedisorders and other internalizing disorders during adolescence and adulthood. Theymay also experience problems in developing and maintaining healthy interpersonalrelationships.• Information about the course features of reactive attachment disorder beyond thechildhood years is limited.• Some adults with a history of reactive attachment disorder may experience difficulty indeveloping interpersonal relationships.Developmental presentations• Caregiver neglect during the first 9 months of life is often an associated precursor to theonset of the disorder.• The features of this disorder become noticeable in a similar fashion up to 5 years of age.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Reactive attachment disorder Disorders specifically associated with stress 357Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with autism spectrum disorderIn contrast to individuals with autism spectrum disorder, children with reactive attachmentdisorder have the capacity for initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocalsocial interactions. Although some children with reactive attachment disorder may show delays inlanguage development due to a history of social neglect, they do not exhibit social communicationdeficits or the persistently restrictive, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests andactivities characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. Some individuals reared under conditionsof severe deprivation in institutional settings exhibit autistic-like features, including difficultiesin social reciprocity and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests oractivities. Also referred to as quasi-autism, affected individuals are differentiated from thosewith autism spectrum disorder based on significant improvement of autism-like features whenthe child is moved to a more nurturing environment.Boundary with disorders of intellectual developmentChildren with disorders of intellectual development are able to form selective attachments tocaregivers. Attachments usually develop consistent with the child’s general developmental level,and are typically evident by the time the child has reached a developmental age of at least 9months. Reactive attachment disorder should only be diagnosed if it is clear that the characteristicproblems in the formation of selective attachments are not a result of limitations in intellectualfunctioning.Boundary with social anxiety disorderSocial anxiety disorder in children may include emotionally withdrawn behaviours in socialsituations, or in anticipation of social encounters, due to marked and excessive fear or anxiety.Unlike in reactive attachment disorder, children with social anxiety disorder exhibit appropriateattachment behaviours with parents or caregivers, and seek comfort from them when distressed,but are typically fearful of unfamiliar individuals. Children with reactive attachment disorderexhibit emotionally withdrawn behaviours across all social contexts.Boundary with depressive disordersAs with reactive attachment disorder, children with depressive disorders may exhibit emotionallywithdrawn behaviour, as well as associated features of lack of social and emotional responsivenessto others, limited positive affect and/or episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness or fearfulness.However, unlike those with reactive attachment disorder, children with depressive disordersexhibit appropriate attachment behaviours with parents or caregivers, and seek comfort fromthem when distressed.Disorders specifically associated with stress | Reactive attachment disorder 358 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders"

However,it is more commonly localized (i.e. failure to recall autobiographical events during acircumscribed period of time) or selective (i.e. failure to recall some but not all of theevents during a circumscribed period of time). The extent of amnesia may vary over time.• Individuals with dissociative amnesia may only be partly aware of their memory problems.Those who are aware of their memory problems may minimize the importance of these,and may become uncomfortable when prompted to address them.• Dissociative amnesia is commonly associated with adverse life events, personal orinterpersonal conflicts, or stress. The link between the disorder and these events,conflicts and stressors may not be apparent to the individual. Repeated or long-lastingtraumatization, trauma caused by multiple perpetrators, and a close relationship with theperpetrator are associated with more persistent and refractory amnesia.• Dissociative amnesia is commonly associated with chronic difficulty in forming andsustaining satisfying interpersonal relationships. The disorder may also be associatedwith self-harm, suicide attempts and other high-risk behaviours, depressive symptoms,depersonalization and sexual dysfunctions.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Mild difficulties remembering autobiographical events are common, especially as a resultof normal ageing. Forgetting early childhood events is also developmentally typical.However, in contrast to dissociative amnesia, normal forgetting:• does not typically involve sustained and extensive forgetting of substantial life episodesor significant personal facts;• is usually reversed following reminders of forgotten episodes and personal facts;• does not have its onset following stressful or traumatic events;• does not result in significant impairment in functioning.Course features• Onset of dissociative amnesia is typically acute, occurring after traumatic or highly stressfulevents (e.g. war, natural disaster, maltreatment). Onset may occur immediately after theexposure or after a significant delay.• Although dissociative amnesia has been observed across the lifespan, it is most commonlydiagnosed in patients between 20 and 40 years of age.• The interval affected by the memory loss and the duration of a given episode of dissociativeamnesia are highly variable. In more acute cases, amnesia resolves spontaneously andDissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia Dissociative disorders 375rapidly (e.g. after a stressor is resolved), whereas in more chronic cases individuals eitherregain the ability to recall the dissociated memories slowly or never fully do. Dissociativeamnesia with dissociative fugue is associated with a more persistent course.• Although single episodes of dissociative amnesia have been reported, individuals who havehad a single episode of dissociative amnesia may be predisposed to develop subsequentepisodes. Most patients experience two or more episodes of dissociative amnesia.• Post-traumatic stress disorder may develop after memories are regained. In such cases,these memories may be experienced in the form of flashbacks.Developmental presentations• Dissociative amnesia can be difficult to detect in young children, whose symptoms maybe misinterpreted as lying, denial, inattention, absorption or developmentally appropriateforgetting. Therefore, assessment of amnesia in children should be based on multipleobservations or reports from several individuals and types of observers (e.g. parents,teachers, other caregivers).• Adults are more likely to experience dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue thanchildren or adolescents.Culture-related features• In cultures with strictly defined social role expectations, dissociative amnesia may beassociated with severe psychological stresses or conflicts (e.g. marital conflict, other familydisturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due to restriction or oppression) rather thanwith traumatic exposures such as physical or sexual abuse.• Amnesia reported after culturally accepted religious activities involving dissociative tranceor possession should not be diagnosed as dissociative amnesia unless it is in excess of whatis considered culturally normative, and is associated with functional impairment.Sex- and/or gender-related features• The prevalence of dissociative amnesia is similar among males and females.Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia 376 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with acute stress reactionAcute stress reaction is a response to an event or situation of an extremely threatening or horrificnature that is considered to be normal given the severity of the stressor. Symptoms of acute stressreaction may include transient amnesia for the immediate period and the event of the stressor.Acute stress reaction begins to subside within a few days after the event or following removalfrom the threatening situation. Dissociative amnesia should be considered as a diagnosis whenthe amnesia includes autobiographical information not directly related to the stressor, or whenthe amnestic episode lasts longer than the immediate aftermath of the stressor (i.e. from severalhours to several days).Boundary with memory deficits in dissociative neurological symptom disorderDissociative neurological symptom disorder may include a variety of cognitive symptoms thatare not due to the direct effects of a substance or a disease of the nervous system. If cognitivesymptoms are focused exclusively on autobiographical memory, dissociative amnesia is the moreappropriate diagnosis.Boundary with possession trance disorderAmnesia may occur in possession trance disorder. However, amnesia in possession trance disorderis related to episodes experienced as involving the intrusion of a new identity attributed to aspirit, power, deity or other spiritual entity. Possession trance disorder also involves behavioursor movements that are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent – symptoms thatare not typically present in dissociative amnesia.Boundary with dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identitydisorderEpisodes of amnesia are common in dissociative identity disorder, and may also occur in partialdissociative identity disorder. However, amnesia in partial dissociative identity disorder is usuallybrief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm. Moreover, dissociativeamnesia is not characterized by the experience of two or more distinct, alternate personalitystates, as is the case in dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity disorder.In dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue, the individual is typically confused about theiridentity. If two or more distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of theindividual’s consciousness and functioning, which may include episodes of amnesia, dissociativeidentity disorder is the more appropriate diagnosis.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stressdisorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, memories of thetraumatic event may be fragmented, disorganized or incomplete. When the amnesia is morepervasive and also involves autobiographical memories that are not related to the traumatic event,and the diagnostic requirements of both disorders are met, an additional diagnosis of dissociativeamnesia may be assigned.Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia Dissociative disorders 377Boundary with disorders due to substance useAmnesia is common in disorders due to substance use – particularly alcohol-related disorders(e.g. alcohol blackouts). If amnesia occurs exclusively in the context of alcohol or drug use,a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is not warranted. However, differential diagnosis may becomplicated in cases in which an individual with a history of dissociative amnestic episodes alsouses alcohol or other substances.Boundary with memory deficits in neurocognitive disorders, head trauma andmedical conditions classified elsewhereNeurocognitive disorders – including delirium, amnestic disorder and dementia – arecharacterized by primary acquired clinical deficits in cognitive functioning, frequently includingsignificant and pervasive memory impairment. In neurocognitive disorders, a specific etiologicalfactor or underlying disease process can often be identified. Memory loss may also occur as aresult of a brain injury, or as an effect of some diseases of the nervous system or medical conditionsclassified elsewhere (e.g. a brain tumour). In dissociative amnesia, memory loss is primarilyfor autobiographical memories, and no underlying disease process or injury that represents apotential etiology for the memory impairment can be identified.Trance disorder and possession trance disorderTrance disorder and possession trance disorder are characterized by recurrent or single andprolonged involuntary marked alteration in an individual’s state of consciousness involvingeither a trance state (without possession) or a possession trance state. The distinctive feature ofpossession trance disorder is that the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replacedby an external possessing identity attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity or otherspiritual entity, which does not occur in trance disorder. In addition, in possession trance disordera greater range of more complex behaviours may be exhibited, which are experienced as beingcontrolled by the possessing agent, whereas trance disorder typically involves the repetition of asmall repertoire of behaviours.Most trance or possession trance states are brief and transitory, and are related to cultural andreligious experiences. These experiences are not considered pathological, and a diagnosis shouldnot be assigned based on their occurrence. Trance and possession trance states should only beconsidered to be features of a mental disorder when they are involuntary and unwanted, notaccepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice, and result in significant distress orsignificant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other importantareas of functioning.Because of the substantial similarity between these disorders, following a separate listing ofthe essential (required) features of each, the other CDDR elements are provided for the twocategories together.Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia 378 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Dissociative amnesia, unspecified","Dissociative amnesia, unspecifiedDissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia 374 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• In rare cases, amnesia may be generalized with regard to identity and life history. However,it is more commonly localized (i.e. failure to recall autobiographical events during acircumscribed period of time) or selective (i.e. failure to recall some but not all of theevents during a circumscribed period of time). The extent of amnesia may vary over time.• Individuals with dissociative amnesia may only be partly aware of their memory problems.Those who are aware of their memory problems may minimize the importance of these,and may become uncomfortable when prompted to address them.• Dissociative amnesia is commonly associated with adverse life events, personal orinterpersonal conflicts, or stress. The link between the disorder and these events,conflicts and stressors may not be apparent to the individual. Repeated or long-lastingtraumatization, trauma caused by multiple perpetrators, and a close relationship with theperpetrator are associated with more persistent and refractory amnesia.• Dissociative amnesia is commonly associated with chronic difficulty in forming andsustaining satisfying interpersonal relationships. The disorder may also be associatedwith self-harm, suicide attempts and other high-risk behaviours, depressive symptoms,depersonalization and sexual dysfunctions.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Mild difficulties remembering autobiographical events are common, especially as a resultof normal ageing. Forgetting early childhood events is also developmentally typical.However, in contrast to dissociative amnesia, normal forgetting:• does not typically involve sustained and extensive forgetting of substantial life episodesor significant personal facts;• is usually reversed following reminders of forgotten episodes and personal facts;• does not have its onset following stressful or traumatic events;• does not result in significant impairment in functioning.Course features• Onset of dissociative amnesia is typically acute, occurring after traumatic or highly stressfulevents (e.g. war, natural disaster, maltreatment). Onset may occur immediately after theexposure or after a significant delay.• Although dissociative amnesia has been observed across the lifespan, it is most commonlydiagnosed in patients between 20 and 40 years of age.• The interval affected by the memory loss and the duration of a given episode of dissociativeamnesia are highly variable. In more acute cases, amnesia resolves spontaneously andDissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia Dissociative disorders 375rapidly (e.g. after a stressor is resolved), whereas in more chronic cases individuals eitherregain the ability to recall the dissociated memories slowly or never fully do. Dissociativeamnesia with dissociative fugue is associated with a more persistent course.• Although single episodes of dissociative amnesia have been reported, individuals who havehad a single episode of dissociative amnesia may be predisposed to develop subsequentepisodes. Most patients experience two or more episodes of dissociative amnesia.• Post-traumatic stress disorder may develop after memories are regained. In such cases,these memories may be experienced in the form of flashbacks.Developmental presentations• Dissociative amnesia can be difficult to detect in young children, whose symptoms maybe misinterpreted as lying, denial, inattention, absorption or developmentally appropriateforgetting. Therefore, assessment of amnesia in children should be based on multipleobservations or reports from several individuals and types of observers (e.g. parents,teachers, other caregivers).• Adults are more likely to experience dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue thanchildren or adolescents.Culture-related features• In cultures with strictly defined social role expectations, dissociative amnesia may beassociated with severe psychological stresses or conflicts (e.g. marital conflict, other familydisturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due to restriction or oppression) rather thanwith traumatic exposures such as physical or sexual abuse.• Amnesia reported after culturally accepted religious activities involving dissociative tranceor possession should not be diagnosed as dissociative amnesia unless it is in excess of whatis considered culturally normative, and is associated with functional impairment.Sex- and/or gender-related features• The prevalence of dissociative amnesia is similar among males and females.Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia 376 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with acute stress reactionAcute stress reaction is a response to an event or situation of an extremely threatening or horrificnature that is considered to be normal given the severity of the stressor. Symptoms of acute stressreaction may include transient amnesia for the immediate period and the event of the stressor.Acute stress reaction begins to subside within a few days after the event or following removalfrom the threatening situation. Dissociative amnesia should be considered as a diagnosis whenthe amnesia includes autobiographical information not directly related to the stressor, or whenthe amnestic episode lasts longer than the immediate aftermath of the stressor (i.e. from severalhours to several days).Boundary with memory deficits in dissociative neurological symptom disorderDissociative neurological symptom disorder may include a variety of cognitive symptoms thatare not due to the direct effects of a substance or a disease of the nervous system. If cognitivesymptoms are focused exclusively on autobiographical memory, dissociative amnesia is the moreappropriate diagnosis.Boundary with possession trance disorderAmnesia may occur in possession trance disorder. However, amnesia in possession trance disorderis related to episodes experienced as involving the intrusion of a new identity attributed to aspirit, power, deity or other spiritual entity. Possession trance disorder also involves behavioursor movements that are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent – symptoms thatare not typically present in dissociative amnesia.Boundary with dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identitydisorderEpisodes of amnesia are common in dissociative identity disorder, and may also occur in partialdissociative identity disorder. However, amnesia in partial dissociative identity disorder is usuallybrief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm. Moreover, dissociativeamnesia is not characterized by the experience of two or more distinct, alternate personalitystates, as is the case in dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity disorder.In dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue, the individual is typically confused about theiridentity. If two or more distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of theindividual’s consciousness and functioning, which may include episodes of amnesia, dissociativeidentity disorder is the more appropriate diagnosis.Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stressdisorderIn post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, memories of thetraumatic event may be fragmented, disorganized or incomplete. When the amnesia is morepervasive and also involves autobiographical memories that are not related to the traumatic event,and the diagnostic requirements of both disorders are met, an additional diagnosis of dissociativeamnesia may be assigned.Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia Dissociative disorders 377Boundary with disorders due to substance useAmnesia is common in disorders due to substance use – particularly alcohol-related disorders(e.g. alcohol blackouts). If amnesia occurs exclusively in the context of alcohol or drug use,a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is not warranted. However, differential diagnosis may becomplicated in cases in which an individual with a history of dissociative amnestic episodes alsouses alcohol or other substances.Boundary with memory deficits in neurocognitive disorders, head trauma andmedical conditions classified elsewhereNeurocognitive disorders – including delirium, amnestic disorder and dementia – arecharacterized by primary acquired clinical deficits in cognitive functioning, frequently includingsignificant and pervasive memory impairment. In neurocognitive disorders, a specific etiologicalfactor or underlying disease process can often be identified. Memory loss may also occur as aresult of a brain injury, or as an effect of some diseases of the nervous system or medical conditionsclassified elsewhere (e.g. a brain tumour). In dissociative amnesia, memory loss is primarilyfor autobiographical memories, and no underlying disease process or injury that represents apotential etiology for the memory impairment can be identified.Trance disorder and possession trance disorderTrance disorder and possession trance disorder are characterized by recurrent or single andprolonged involuntary marked alteration in an individual’s state of consciousness involvingeither a trance state (without possession) or a possession trance state.

Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. One personality state is dominant and normally functions in daily life, but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive, affective, perceptual, motor, or behavioural. They are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning, but there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours, such as in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.Partial dissociative identity disorderEssential (required) features• Disruption of identity characterized by the experience of two or more distinct personalitystates (dissociative identities), involving discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, isrequired for diagnosis.

If functioning is maintained, it isonly through significant additional effort.Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder 388 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• The dissociative intrusions attributed to non-dominant personality states by individualswith partial dissociative identity disorder are experienced internally, and may not beobvious to observers. Observable identity alteration is typically indicative of dissociativeidentity disorder.• Individuals with partial dissociative identity disorder often do not experience amnesiaduring episodes of dissociative intrusions. If amnesia does occur, it is usually brief andrestricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm.• Partial dissociative identity disorder is commonly associated with serious or chronictraumatic life events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse.Boundary with normality (threshold)• The presence of distinct personality states or dissociative intrusions does not alwaysindicate the presence of a mental disorder. In certain circumstances (e.g. as experienced bymediums or other culturally accepted spiritual practitioners), the presence of multiplepersonality states is not experienced as aversive and is not associated with impairment infunctioning. A diagnosis of partial dissociative identity disorder should not be assigned inthese cases.Course features• Partial dissociative identity disorder is strongly linked to traumatic experiences – especiallyphysical, sexual and emotional abuse or childhood neglect. The onset of identity changescan also be triggered by removal from ongoing traumatizing circumstances, by death orserious illness of the perpetrator of abuse, or by other unrelated traumatic experienceslater in life.• Partial dissociative identity disorder usually has a recurrent and fluctuating clinical course.Although symptoms might reduce spontaneously with age in older adults, periods ofincreased stress can cause recurrence of symptoms. Factors such as re-traumatization orchronically ongoing abuse tend to predict a poorer prognosis.• Partial dissociative identity disorder often co-occurs with other mental disorders.In such cases, identity alternations can influence the symptom presentation of theco-occurring disorders.Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder Dissociative disorders 389Developmental presentations• Disorganized attachment in childhood might put individuals at risk of developing partialdissociative identity disorder later in life.• The onset of partial dissociative identity disorder may occur at any stage of life, from earlychildhood to late adulthood.• Diagnosis in pre-adolescent children might be particularly challenging, as partialdissociative identity disorder in children can manifest in a variety of ways, includingconduct problems, mood and anxiety symptoms, learning difficulties or what appear tobe auditory hallucinations. Also, young children often project their dissociated identitiesonto toys or other objects, so that abnormalities in their identity may become detectableonly as children age and their behaviours become less developmentally appropriate. Givenadequate treatment, children with partial dissociative identity disorder tend to have abetter prognosis than adults.• Early identity changes in adolescence characteristic of partial dissociative identity disordermay be mistaken for developmentally typical difficulties with emotional and behaviouralregulation.• Older patients with partial dissociative identity disorder may present with what appearsto be late-life paranoia, cognitive dysfunction, atypical mood, psychotic symptoms orobsessive-compulsive symptoms.Culture-related features• Features of partial dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual’scultural background. For example, individuals may present with dissociative symptomsof movement, behaviour or cognition – such as non-epileptic seizures and convulsions,paralyses or sensory loss – in sociocultural settings where such symptoms are common.• In some societies, presentations of partial dissociative identity disorder may occur afterstressful exposures (e.g. recurrent parental affect dysregulation), which may or may notinvolve physical or sexual abuse. The tendency towards dissociative responses to stressorsmay be increased in cultures with less individualistic (bounded) conceptions of the self,or in circumstances of socioeconomic deprivation.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Females appear to be more likely to experience identity intrusions.Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder 390 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with trance disorder and possession trance disorderSome dissociative intrusions in partial dissociative identity disorder may resemble trance states,but trance disorder is not characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states.In possession trance disorder, the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replaced by anexternal possessing identity, which is attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity or otherspiritual entity. Behaviours or movements are experienced as being controlled by the possessingagent. Individuals who experience dissociative intrusions attributed to both internal and externalentities should receive a diagnosis of partial dissociative identity disorder rather than possessiontrance disorder.Boundary with dissociative identity disorderIn dissociative identity disorder, discontinuities in agency and sense of self are marked (manifestedin episodes of executive control – often including amnesia – and greater elaboration of thepersonality states), whereas in partial dissociative identity disorder, these discontinuities are lesspronounced. In dissociative identity disorder, two or more distinct personality states recurrentlytake executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the extent that theyfunction in daily life or engage in relatively elaborate patterns of behaviour in specific situations.In contrast, in partial dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant, alternate personality statesdo not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to theextent that they perform in specific aspects of daily life, although there may be occasional, limitedand transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engagein circumscribed behaviours (e.g. in response to extreme emotional states, episodes of self-harmor the re-enactment of traumatic memories). In partial dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant alternate personality states are not elaborated to the extent observed in dissociativeidentity disorder. For example, they may not be oriented to the present, may have the identity of achild, or may be mostly or exclusively involved in re-enacting traumatic memories. Furthermore,in dissociative identity disorder there are typically (although not always) significant episodes ofamnesia, which may be severe. In partial dissociative identity disorder, amnesia – if present – isusually brief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm.Boundary with other dissociative disordersPartial dissociative identity disorder is distinguished from other dissociative disorders by thepresence of two or more distinct personality states. This does not occur in any other dissociativedisorder (except dissociative identity disorder, as described above). An additional dissociativedisorder diagnosis should not be assigned based on phenomena that occur in specific relationshipto intrusions by non-dominant personality states (e.g. memory loss, changes in motor or sensoryfunctioning, experiences of depersonalization and derealization).Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disordersIndividuals with partial dissociative identity disorder may report experiencing symptoms suchas hearing voices or intrusive thoughts that may also occur in schizophrenia and other primarypsychotic disorders.

Loss of control over eating maybe described by the individual as feeling like they cannot stop or limit the amount or typeof food eaten; having difficulty stopping eating once they have started; or giving up eventrying to control their eating because they know they will end up overeating.• The presentation is characterized by repeated inappropriate compensatory behaviours toprevent weight gain (e.g. once a week or more over a period of at least 1 month). The mostcommon compensatory behaviour is self-induced vomiting, which typically occurs withinan hour of binge eating.

For example, women who report strong identification with African American orBlack Caribbean culture also tend to report larger body ideals and higher body satisfaction,yet tend to have elevated rates of binge eating.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Binge-eating disorder is more prevalent among females.• There are no significant gender-related differences in the symptoms or course of binge-eating disorder.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with bulimia nervosaIf an individual regularly engages in inappropriate compensatory behaviours following episodesof binge eating (e.g. self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives, enemas, diuretics, fasting, strenuousexercise or omitting insulin), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa rather than binge-eating disordershould be assigned.Boundary with obesityObesity is a common consequence of binge-eating disorder and should be recorded separately.However, obese individuals who report overeating patterns that do not meet the definition ofbinge eating should not be diagnosed with binge-eating disorder."
185,6B83,Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder,"Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterised by avoidance or restriction of food intake that results in: 1) the intake of an insufficient quantity or variety of food to meet adequate energy or nutritional requirements that has resulted in significant weight loss, clinically significant nutritional deficiencies, dependence on oral nutritional supplements or tube feeding, or has otherwise negatively affected the physical health of the individual~ or 2) significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to avoidance or distress related to participating in social experiences involving eating). The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight or shape. Restricted food intake and its effects on weight, other aspects of health, or functioning are not due to unavailability of food, not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. food allergies, hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder, and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system including withdrawal effects.",,Anorexia Nervosa; Feeding problem of infant; Feeding problems of newborn,"Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorderEssential (required) features• Avoidance or restriction of food intake is required for diagnosis, which results in either orboth of the following:• the intake of an insufficient quantity or variety of food to meet adequate energy ornutritional requirements that has resulted in significant weight loss, clinically significantnutritional deficiencies, dependence on oral nutritional supplements or tube feeding, orhas otherwise negatively affected the physical health of the individual;• significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning (e.g. due to avoidance or distress related to participatingin social experiences involving eating).Feeding and eating disorders | Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder Feeding and eating disorders 411• The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight orshape.• Restricted food intake and consequent weight loss (or failure to gain weight), or otherimpacts on physical health or related functional impairment, are not due to unavailabilityof food; are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. food allergies,hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder; and are not due to the effects of a substance ormedication, including withdrawal effects.Additional clinical features• A variety of reasons may be given for restriction of food intake, such as lack of interest ineating, avoidance of foods with certain sensory characteristics (e.g. smell, taste, appearance,texture, colour, temperature) or concern about perceived aversive consequences of eating(e.g. choking, vomiting, health problems), which in some cases is related to a history ofaversive food-related experience such as choking or vomiting after eating a particular typeof food.

The difference is that in anorexia nervosa, behaviours to establishor maintain an abnormally low body weight are usually explicitly motivated by a desire forthinness or an intense fear of gaining weight. However, other rationales for disturbances in eatingbehaviours or weight loss in anorexia nervosa may be given, such as fear of physical discomfort(e.g. stomach bloating), self-punishment, or religious or moral reasons. In cases in which theindividual otherwise meets the diagnostic requirements of anorexia nervosa but weight- orshape-related concerns are not explicitly endorsed, the altered eating behaviours should only beconsidered diagnostic of anorexia nervosa if clinical observation or collateral history supports theconclusion that they are motivated by an intention to lose weight or to prevent weight gain. Someindividuals initially diagnosed with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may exhibit moreexplicit weight- or shape-related concerns over the course of treatment as they begin to alter theireating behaviours and to gain weight. In such cases, it may be appropriate to change the diagnosisto anorexia nervosa if all diagnostic requirements are met.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderIn some individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, the pattern of food avoidancestems from sensory sensitivities related to the smell, taste, temperature, texture or appearanceof foods. For example, an individual may eat only foods of a particular colour, or will refusesolids or accept only a very narrow range of foods based on packaging or a particular brand.Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also restrict intake of certain foods becauseof their sensory characteristics (e.g. hypersensitivity to food texture) or because of inflexibleadherence to particular routines (e.g. eating the same foods at the same time in the same order oronly eating specific brands of food with specific packaging). However, autism spectrum disorderis also characterized by persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communicationand reciprocal social interactions, and persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns ofbehaviour, interests or activities that are unrelated to food. If a pattern of restricted eating inan individual with autism spectrum disorder has caused significant weight loss or other healthconsequences or is specifically associated with significant functional impairment, an additionaldiagnosis of avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may be assigned.Boundary with specific phobia and other anxiety and fear-related disordersIn some individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, food avoidance may be relatedto perceived aversive consequences of eating (e.g. fear that swallowing particular foods may causeone to gag, choke or vomit, or concern about the development of health problems such as heartdisease or cancer related to food intake). Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is commonlyassociated with anxiety symptoms in situations related to eating or food, which may becomeworse over time as the disorder evolves. If the pattern and intensity of anxiety symptoms in anindividual with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder meet all diagnostic requirements ofspecific phobia or another anxiety or fear-related disorder, both diagnoses may be assigned.Feeding and eating disorders | Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder 414 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with other mental disordersIndividuals experiencing a depressive episode may present with a lack of appetite or reducedinterest in eating, and weight loss associated with depressed mood and other cognitive-behaviouralor neurovegetative symptoms of a depressive episode.

202,6C21,Body integrity dysphoria,"Body integrity dysphoria is characterised by an intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. major limb amputee, paraplegic, blind), with onset by early adolescence accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration. The desire to become physically disabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by either the preoccupation with the desire (including time spent pretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with productivity, with leisure activities, or with social functioning (e.g. person is unwilling to have a close relationship because it would make it difficult to pretend) or by attempts to actually become disabled having resulted in the person putting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, by a Disease of the Nervous System or by another medical condition, or by Malingering.",,Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood,"Body integrity dysphoriaEssential (required) features• An intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. amajor limb amputation, paraplegia, blindness) accompanied by persistent discomfort orintense negative feelings about one’s current body configuration or functioning, is requiredfor diagnosis.• The desire to be disabled results in harmful consequences, manifested in either or both ofthe following:• attempts to actually become disabled through self-injury, which have resulted in theperson putting their health or life in significant jeopardy;• preoccupation with the desire to be disabled, resulting in significant impairment inpersonal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning(e.g. avoidance of close relationships, interference with work productivity).• Onset of the persistent desire to be disabled occurs by early adolescence.• The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophreniaor another primary psychotic disorder – in which, for example, a delusional convictionthat the limb belongs to another person may be present – or factitious disorder) or bymalingering.• The symptoms or behaviours are not better accounted for by gender incongruence, by adisease of the nervous system or by another medical condition.Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria 436 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• It is common for individuals to describe their discomfort in terms of feeling like theyshould have been born with the desired disability (e.g. missing a leg).• Most individuals with this condition exhibit associated pretending or simulationbehaviour (e.g. binding one’s leg to simulate being a person with a limb amputation, orusing a wheelchair or crutches), which is often the first manifestation of the condition.These behaviours are usually done in secret. The need for secrecy may result in avoidanceor termination of intimate relationships that would interfere with opportunitiesfor simulation.• Some individuals who attempt to make themselves disabled through self-injury try tocover up the self-inflicted nature of the attempt by making it look like an accident.• Many individuals with body integrity dysphoria have a sexual component to their desire– either being sexually attracted to individuals with certain disabilities or being intenselysexually aroused at the thought of being disabled.• Shame about the desire to be disabled is common in individuals with body integritydysphoria, and most individuals keep this desire a closely guarded secret because of a fearof being rejected or thought to be crazy by others. It is common for the family, friends,co-workers and even their partners or spouses of individuals with body integrity dysphoriato be unaware of their desire. Some may seek treatment for associated depressive or othersymptoms and yet not share their desire to be disabled with their health-care provider.• It is assumed that most individuals with body integrity dysphoria never come to clinicalattention. When they do, it is generally as adults – often when they seek the assistanceof a health-care professional to relieve their distress, to help them actualize their desireddisability, or because they have injured themselves in an attempt to become disabled.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Some individuals, especially children and adolescents, may have time-limited periods inwhich they pretend to have a disability such as blindness out of curiosity about what it islike to live as a disabled person. Such individuals do not experience a persistent desire tobecome disabled or the harmful consequences associated with body integrity dysphoria.Course features• The typical course is for the intensity of the desire to become disabled and consequentfunctional impairment to wax and wane. There may be periods of time where the intensityof the desire and the accompanying dysphoria is so great that the individual can think ofDisorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience 437nothing else, and may make plans or take action to become disabled. At other times, thedesire to become disabled and the associated intense negative feelings abate, although atno time does it completely cease to be present.Developmental presentations• The onset of body integrity dysphoria is most commonly in early to mid-childhood,although some cases have their onset in adolescence. The first manifestation is typicallythe child pretending to have the desired disability, often in secret.Culture-related features• Although apparently quite rare, cases have been reported in many different countriesand cultures.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Among those who come to clinical attention, prevalence appears to be higher among males.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with schizophrenia, other primary psychotic disorders, and other mentaldisorders with psychotic symptomsSomatic delusions may involve the conviction that a part of the person’s body does not belongto them. In such cases, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, or amood disorder with psychotic symptoms should be considered. Individuals with body integritydysphoria do not harbour false beliefs about external reality related to their desire to be disabled,and thus are not considered to be delusional. Instead, they experience an internal feeling that theywould be right only if they were disabled.Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderObsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by repetitive and persistent thoughts, images orurges that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted (ego-dystonic). In contrast, the repetitiveDisorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria 438 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersthoughts, images and impulses related to the desire to become disabled in body integritydysphoria (e.g. fantasies of being disabled) are ego-syntonic, and are not experienced as intrusive,unwanted or distressing. Distress in body integrity dysphoria is typically related to not being ableto actualize the disability, or to fear of the negative judgements of others.Boundary with body dysmorphic disorderIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder have persistent preoccupations about a part of theirbody that they believe is defective, or a perception that their appearance overall is ugly. In contrast,individuals with body integrity dysphoria are persistently preoccupied with a sense that the waytheir body is configured (e.g. for those who desire an amputation) or functions (e.g. for those whowant to be paraplegic or blind) is wrong, unnatural and not as it should be.Boundary with paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consentingindividualSome individuals have a paraphilic focus of intense sexual arousal involving the fantasy ofhaving a serious disability, which may be associated with transient periods of wanting to acquirethe disability that is the source of arousal. If the desire to acquire a disability occurs solely inconnection with sexual arousal, body integrity dysphoria should not be diagnosed. A diagnosisof paraphilic disorder involved solitary behaviour or consenting individuals may be appropriatein such cases, if the individual is markedly distressed about this arousal pattern or if they haveinjured themselves as a part of enacting sexual fantasies related to it.Boundary with factitious disorder and malingeringIndividuals with body integrity disorder often simulate their desired disability as a way ofreducing their negative feelings (e.g. a person who desires to be paraplegic may spend part or allof their time using a wheelchair). Moreover, they typically shun medical attention. In contrast,individuals with factitious disorder feign medical or psychological signs or symptoms in order toseek attention – especially from health-care providers – and to assume the sick role.

The desire to become physically disabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by either the preoccupation with the desire (including time spent pretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with productivity, with leisure activities, or with social functioning (e.g. person is unwilling to have a close relationship because it would make it difficult to pretend) or by attempts to actually become disabled having resulted in the person putting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, by a Disease of the Nervous System or by another medical condition, or by Malingering.If you diagnose this disease exclude: Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthoodBody integrity dysphoriaEssential (required) features• An intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. amajor limb amputation, paraplegia, blindness) accompanied by persistent discomfort orintense negative feelings about one’s current body configuration or functioning, is requiredfor diagnosis.• The desire to be disabled results in harmful consequences, manifested in either or both ofthe following:• attempts to actually become disabled through self-injury, which have resulted in theperson putting their health or life in significant jeopardy;• preoccupation with the desire to be disabled, resulting in significant impairment inpersonal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning(e.g. avoidance of close relationships, interference with work productivity).• Onset of the persistent desire to be disabled occurs by early adolescence.• The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophreniaor another primary psychotic disorder – in which, for example, a delusional convictionthat the limb belongs to another person may be present – or factitious disorder) or bymalingering.• The symptoms or behaviours are not better accounted for by gender incongruence, by adisease of the nervous system or by another medical condition.Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria 436 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersAdditional clinical features• It is common for individuals to describe their discomfort in terms of feeling like theyshould have been born with the desired disability (e.g. missing a leg).• Most individuals with this condition exhibit associated pretending or simulationbehaviour (e.g. binding one’s leg to simulate being a person with a limb amputation, orusing a wheelchair or crutches), which is often the first manifestation of the condition.These behaviours are usually done in secret. The need for secrecy may result in avoidanceor termination of intimate relationships that would interfere with opportunitiesfor simulation.• Some individuals who attempt to make themselves disabled through self-injury try tocover up the self-inflicted nature of the attempt by making it look like an accident.• Many individuals with body integrity dysphoria have a sexual component to their desire– either being sexually attracted to individuals with certain disabilities or being intenselysexually aroused at the thought of being disabled.• Shame about the desire to be disabled is common in individuals with body integritydysphoria, and most individuals keep this desire a closely guarded secret because of a fearof being rejected or thought to be crazy by others. It is common for the family, friends,co-workers and even their partners or spouses of individuals with body integrity dysphoriato be unaware of their desire. Some may seek treatment for associated depressive or othersymptoms and yet not share their desire to be disabled with their health-care provider.• It is assumed that most individuals with body integrity dysphoria never come to clinicalattention. When they do, it is generally as adults – often when they seek the assistanceof a health-care professional to relieve their distress, to help them actualize their desireddisability, or because they have injured themselves in an attempt to become disabled.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Some individuals, especially children and adolescents, may have time-limited periods inwhich they pretend to have a disability such as blindness out of curiosity about what it islike to live as a disabled person. Such individuals do not experience a persistent desire tobecome disabled or the harmful consequences associated with body integrity dysphoria.Course features• The typical course is for the intensity of the desire to become disabled and consequentfunctional impairment to wax and wane. There may be periods of time where the intensityof the desire and the accompanying dysphoria is so great that the individual can think ofDisorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience 437nothing else, and may make plans or take action to become disabled. At other times, thedesire to become disabled and the associated intense negative feelings abate, although atno time does it completely cease to be present.Developmental presentations• The onset of body integrity dysphoria is most commonly in early to mid-childhood,although some cases have their onset in adolescence. The first manifestation is typicallythe child pretending to have the desired disability, often in secret.Culture-related features• Although apparently quite rare, cases have been reported in many different countriesand cultures.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Among those who come to clinical attention, prevalence appears to be higher among males.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with schizophrenia, other primary psychotic disorders, and other mentaldisorders with psychotic symptomsSomatic delusions may involve the conviction that a part of the person’s body does not belongto them. In such cases, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, or amood disorder with psychotic symptoms should be considered. Individuals with body integritydysphoria do not harbour false beliefs about external reality related to their desire to be disabled,and thus are not considered to be delusional. Instead, they experience an internal feeling that theywould be right only if they were disabled.Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderObsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by repetitive and persistent thoughts, images orurges that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted (ego-dystonic). In contrast, the repetitiveDisorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria 438 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersthoughts, images and impulses related to the desire to become disabled in body integritydysphoria (e.g. fantasies of being disabled) are ego-syntonic, and are not experienced as intrusive,unwanted or distressing. Distress in body integrity dysphoria is typically related to not being ableto actualize the disability, or to fear of the negative judgements of others.Boundary with body dysmorphic disorderIndividuals with body dysmorphic disorder have persistent preoccupations about a part of theirbody that they believe is defective, or a perception that their appearance overall is ugly. In contrast,individuals with body integrity dysphoria are persistently preoccupied with a sense that the waytheir body is configured (e.g. for those who desire an amputation) or functions (e.g. for those whowant to be paraplegic or blind) is wrong, unnatural and not as it should be.Boundary with paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consentingindividualSome individuals have a paraphilic focus of intense sexual arousal involving the fantasy ofhaving a serious disability, which may be associated with transient periods of wanting to acquirethe disability that is the source of arousal. If the desire to acquire a disability occurs solely inconnection with sexual arousal, body integrity dysphoria should not be diagnosed. A diagnosisof paraphilic disorder involved solitary behaviour or consenting individuals may be appropriatein such cases, if the individual is markedly distressed about this arousal pattern or if they haveinjured themselves as a part of enacting sexual fantasies related to it.Boundary with factitious disorder and malingeringIndividuals with body integrity disorder often simulate their desired disability as a way ofreducing their negative feelings (e.g. a person who desires to be paraplegic may spend part or allof their time using a wheelchair). Moreover, they typically shun medical attention. In contrast,individuals with factitious disorder feign medical or psychological signs or symptoms in order toseek attention – especially from health-care providers – and to assume the sick role. Malingeringis characterized by feigning of medical or psychological signs or symptoms for obvious externalincentives (e.g. disability payments).Boundary with diseases of the nervous systemSome diseases of the nervous system may cause symptoms that involve profound changes in theperson’s attitude towards and experience of their own bodies (e.g. somatoparaphrenia, in whicha paralysed body part is experienced as alien or as belonging to someone else.)

Determination of the etiology ofthe disturbances in psychophysiological functions or responses may require longitudinalassessment.• A diagnosis of intoxication due to unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances canbe assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown to the clinician. As moreinformation becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant)the diagnosis should be changed to indicate the substance responsible for intoxication.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 472 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with normality (threshold)• Measurement of the presence or concentration of a substance in breath, blood, saliva, urineor other body fluids may be an important tool in the clinical management of substanceintoxication. However, detection of a psychoactive substance in body fluids does notconstitute a presumptive diagnosis of substance intoxication.Course features• The onset of substance intoxication varies according to the route of administration, theabsorption of the substance and other pharmacokinetic factors. Generally, inhalation(smoking) and intravenous injecting routes lead to more rapid onset of intoxication,although oral ingestion may also lead to intoxication within minutes, depending on thesubstance.• Substance intoxication is a transient condition, with the duration of intoxicationdepending on multiple factors, including the dose of the substance taken, the half-life andduration of action of the particular substance, and the formulation of the substance taken(e.g. for pharmaceutical preparations, whether a controlled-release drug has been taken).Intoxication may last from a few minutes to several days following the episode of use. Theintensity of intoxication lessens with time after reaching a peak of absorption, and theeffects eventually disappear in the absence of further use of the substance.Developmental presentations• Naive users – including adolescents – can show features of intoxication at lower levels ofuse, reflecting lower physical and learned tolerance.• Older adults may have a lower tolerance than younger people to the effects of alcohol andother substances.Culture-related features• The degree and characteristics of intoxication displayed for a given amount of the substancevary considerably with circumstances, with beliefs and expectations about the effects ofthe substance, and with the cultural acceptability of displaying these effects. These factorsresult in cultural differences in the extent and manifestations of intoxication.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 473• There are also genetic differences in susceptibility to intoxication associated with certainethnic groups. Cultural and ethnically linked genetic factors have been better documentedfor alcohol than for other substances.Sex- and/or gender-related features• The amount of substance and duration of use necessary to cause intoxication differs by sex,reflecting differences in body weight and composition.• Behaviour while intoxicated may vary by gender, reflecting not only physiologicaldifferences but also cultural differences and role expectations.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and harmful patternof psychoactive substance useIn episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and harmful pattern of psychoactive substanceuse, consumption or administration of a substance results in damage to the person’s physical ormental health (including a substance-induced mental disorder) or in behaviour leading to harm tothe health of others. Recovery from substance intoxication is generally complete. Complicationsdue to such effects of intoxication such as injury, the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolongedhyperactivity or inactivity, or other tissue damage should be diagnosed as episode of harmfulpsychoactive substance use or harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, as appropriate. Ifrelevant at the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), substance intoxicationcan be given as an associated diagnosis, with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use orharmful pattern of psychoactive substance use as the primary diagnosis.Boundary with substance dependenceEpisodic or continuous intoxication with a substance or substances is a typical feature of substancedependence. If all diagnostic requirements of both conditions are met for the same episode of care,substance dependence should be assigned as the primary diagnosis, with an associated diagnosisof substance intoxication (e.g. opioid dependence with opioid intoxication).Boundary with substance withdrawalSubstance withdrawal occurs upon cessation or reduction of a substance in the context ofphysiological dependence or when a substance has been taken for a prolonged period or inlarge amounts. In contrast, the onset of substance intoxication occurs immediately or shortlyafter the consumption of a substance. Moreover, for a particular substance, the intoxication andwithdrawal syndromes are typically quite distinct. See Table 6.15 (p. 475) for a description of thesubstance-specific features of substance intoxication and Table 6.16 (p. 484) for a description ofthe substance-specific features of substance withdrawal.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 474 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with substance-induced deliriumDelirium is characterized by disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness that developwithin a short period of time, with symptoms that are transient and may fluctuate dependingon the underlying etiology. Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, andmay include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Disturbance of the sleep-wake cyclemay also be present. Delirium can be caused by intoxication or withdrawal from substances.When symptoms of delirium are attributable to substance intoxication, an associated diagnosisof substance-induced delirium should be assigned in addition to the diagnosis of substanceintoxication. Note: substance-induced delirium is only applicable for some substances orsubstance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).Boundary with other substance-induced mental disordersMental or behavioural symptoms that arise during substance intoxication should only be usedas a basis for diagnosing a substance-induced mental disorder if the intensity or duration of thesymptoms is substantially in excess of those that are characteristic of substance intoxication dueto the specified substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475), and the symptoms are sufficiently severe towarrant specific clinical attention.Boundary with other medical conditionsA variety of medical conditions may produce symptoms that are similar to those of substanceintoxication (see Box 6.1 for examples). Some of these medical conditions are life-threatening,and require immediate intervention. Evidence of substance use (e.g. positive laboratory results)does not rule out the possibility of a comorbid medical condition. These alternative diagnosesmust be considered in assessing substance intoxication. Certain medical conditions may alsoaugment or prolong the duration of intoxication. Symptoms of intoxication that persist afterthey can no longer be reasonably attributed to the pharmacological effects of the substance maysuggest the presence of another medical condition. If it is determined that substance intoxicationis comorbid with a medical condition, both diagnoses should be assigned.Boundary with overdoseWhen consumption or administration of psychoactive substances results in symptoms of overdose(e.g. coma, life-threatening cardiac or respiratory suppression), it is typically more appropriate toapply a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects of substances in Chapter 22 on injury,poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes rather than substance intoxication.Table 6.15 sets out the disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviouror coordination that are most characteristic of intoxication with each class of psychoactivesubstances in the grouping of disorders due to substance use. These features are caused by theknown pharmacological effects of the substance. Their intensity is closely related to the amount ofthe substance consumed, as well as the route of administration, interaction of the substance withother substances – including medications – and the duration of action of the substance. They aretime-limited, and abate as the substance is cleared from the body.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 475Table 6.15. Common substance-specific features of substanceintoxicationSubstance Common substance-specific featuresAlcohol Presenting features of alcohol intoxication may include impaired attention,inappropriate or aggressive behaviour, lability of mood and emotions, impairedjudgement, poor coordination, unsteady gait, and slurred speech. At more severelevels of intoxication, stupor or coma may occur.Additional features• Alcohol intoxication may be associated with impaired social interaction.• Impaired coordination and judgement due to alcohol intoxication, even at lowdoses, may be sufficiently severe to affect the faculties necessary to operatemotorized vehicles safely: alcohol intoxication is an important risk factor for roadaccidents.• The disinhibiting effects of alcohol are associated with an increased risk ofattempted and completed suicides.• Higher blood levels of alcohol (e.g. >150 mg/dL) are associated with stupor andcoma. Blood levels of alcohol above 250 mg/dL can cause respiratory depression,cardiac arrhythmias and death.• Stupor and coma are more likely to occur in individuals with low tolerance orcomorbid medical conditions.• The more severe the intoxication, the greater the likelihood of subsequentamnesia for events that took place during the period of intoxication (blackouts).• Some symptoms of intoxication with other substances (e.g. sedatives, hypnoticsor anxiolytics; opioids) may be similar to those of alcohol intoxication. Evidence ofalcohol use (e.g. the smell of alcohol on the breath) does not rule out concomitantintoxication with other substances.Cannabis or synthetic Presenting features of cannabis intoxication or synthetic cannabinoid intoxicationcannabinoids may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgement,perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception oftime), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinaryexperiences, impaired short-term memory and sluggishness. Physical signs includeconjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes), dry mouth and tachycardia.Additional features• The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is cannabis is THC. Disturbances inconsciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour or coordination typical ofcannabis intoxication are primarily attributable to levels of THC, although variousother cannabinoids are also present in cannabis preparations (e.g. dried leavesand buds, hashish, cannabis oil).• Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication may cause delirium or acute psychosis.• Regular intoxication with high potency cannabis or synthetic cannabinoids may beassociated with increased long-term risk of psychosis.Note: medicinal cannabinoids such as cannabidiol and cannabinol – for example,those used as antispasmodics, anxiolytics or analgesics – typically have no orminimal intoxicating effects. However, standard laboratory testing for cannabinoidsmay not be able to differentiate among these different types of cannabinoids.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 476 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersTable 6.15. contdSubstance Common substance-specific featuresOpioids Presenting features of opioid intoxication may include somnolence, stupor, moodchanges (e.g. euphoria followed by apathy and dysphoria), psychomotor retardation,impaired judgement, respiratory depression, slurred speech, and impairment ofmemory and attention. In severe intoxication, coma may ensue. A characteristicphysical sign is pupillary constriction, but this sign may be absent when intoxicationis due to synthetic opioids.Additional features• Severe opioid intoxication can lead to death due to excessive respiratorydepression.

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of the multiple specified psychoactive substances and their intensity is closely related to the amount of the substances consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the multiple specified substances are cleared from the body.Intoxication due tomultiple specified psychoactive substances.• Substance intoxication may occur in the presence of medical conditions that causeimpairment of levels of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour orcoordination, which should be diagnosed separately. Determination of the etiology ofthe disturbances in psychophysiological functions or responses may require longitudinalassessment.• A diagnosis of intoxication due to unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances canbe assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown to the clinician. As moreinformation becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant)the diagnosis should be changed to indicate the substance responsible for intoxication.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 472 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with normality (threshold)• Measurement of the presence or concentration of a substance in breath, blood, saliva, urineor other body fluids may be an important tool in the clinical management of substanceintoxication. However, detection of a psychoactive substance in body fluids does notconstitute a presumptive diagnosis of substance intoxication.Course features• The onset of substance intoxication varies according to the route of administration, theabsorption of the substance and other pharmacokinetic factors. Generally, inhalation(smoking) and intravenous injecting routes lead to more rapid onset of intoxication,although oral ingestion may also lead to intoxication within minutes, depending on thesubstance.• Substance intoxication is a transient condition, with the duration of intoxicationdepending on multiple factors, including the dose of the substance taken, the half-life andduration of action of the particular substance, and the formulation of the substance taken(e.g. for pharmaceutical preparations, whether a controlled-release drug has been taken).Intoxication may last from a few minutes to several days following the episode of use. Theintensity of intoxication lessens with time after reaching a peak of absorption, and theeffects eventually disappear in the absence of further use of the substance.Developmental presentations• Naive users – including adolescents – can show features of intoxication at lower levels ofuse, reflecting lower physical and learned tolerance.• Older adults may have a lower tolerance than younger people to the effects of alcohol andother substances.Culture-related features• The degree and characteristics of intoxication displayed for a given amount of the substancevary considerably with circumstances, with beliefs and expectations about the effects ofthe substance, and with the cultural acceptability of displaying these effects. These factorsresult in cultural differences in the extent and manifestations of intoxication.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 473• There are also genetic differences in susceptibility to intoxication associated with certainethnic groups. Cultural and ethnically linked genetic factors have been better documentedfor alcohol than for other substances.Sex- and/or gender-related features• The amount of substance and duration of use necessary to cause intoxication differs by sex,reflecting differences in body weight and composition.• Behaviour while intoxicated may vary by gender, reflecting not only physiologicaldifferences but also cultural differences and role expectations.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and harmful patternof psychoactive substance useIn episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and harmful pattern of psychoactive substanceuse, consumption or administration of a substance results in damage to the person’s physical ormental health (including a substance-induced mental disorder) or in behaviour leading to harm tothe health of others. Recovery from substance intoxication is generally complete. Complicationsdue to such effects of intoxication such as injury, the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolongedhyperactivity or inactivity, or other tissue damage should be diagnosed as episode of harmfulpsychoactive substance use or harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, as appropriate. Ifrelevant at the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), substance intoxicationcan be given as an associated diagnosis, with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use orharmful pattern of psychoactive substance use as the primary diagnosis.Boundary with substance dependenceEpisodic or continuous intoxication with a substance or substances is a typical feature of substancedependence. If all diagnostic requirements of both conditions are met for the same episode of care,substance dependence should be assigned as the primary diagnosis, with an associated diagnosisof substance intoxication (e.g. opioid dependence with opioid intoxication).Boundary with substance withdrawalSubstance withdrawal occurs upon cessation or reduction of a substance in the context ofphysiological dependence or when a substance has been taken for a prolonged period or inlarge amounts. In contrast, the onset of substance intoxication occurs immediately or shortlyafter the consumption of a substance. Moreover, for a particular substance, the intoxication andwithdrawal syndromes are typically quite distinct. See Table 6.15 (p. 475) for a description of thesubstance-specific features of substance intoxication and Table 6.16 (p. 484) for a description ofthe substance-specific features of substance withdrawal.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 474 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with substance-induced deliriumDelirium is characterized by disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness that developwithin a short period of time, with symptoms that are transient and may fluctuate dependingon the underlying etiology. Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, andmay include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Disturbance of the sleep-wake cyclemay also be present. Delirium can be caused by intoxication or withdrawal from substances.When symptoms of delirium are attributable to substance intoxication, an associated diagnosisof substance-induced delirium should be assigned in addition to the diagnosis of substanceintoxication. Note: substance-induced delirium is only applicable for some substances orsubstance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).Boundary with other substance-induced mental disordersMental or behavioural symptoms that arise during substance intoxication should only be usedas a basis for diagnosing a substance-induced mental disorder if the intensity or duration of thesymptoms is substantially in excess of those that are characteristic of substance intoxication dueto the specified substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475), and the symptoms are sufficiently severe towarrant specific clinical attention.Boundary with other medical conditionsA variety of medical conditions may produce symptoms that are similar to those of substanceintoxication (see Box 6.1 for examples). Some of these medical conditions are life-threatening,and require immediate intervention. Evidence of substance use (e.g. positive laboratory results)does not rule out the possibility of a comorbid medical condition. These alternative diagnosesmust be considered in assessing substance intoxication. Certain medical conditions may alsoaugment or prolong the duration of intoxication. Symptoms of intoxication that persist afterthey can no longer be reasonably attributed to the pharmacological effects of the substance maysuggest the presence of another medical condition. If it is determined that substance intoxicationis comorbid with a medical condition, both diagnoses should be assigned.Boundary with overdoseWhen consumption or administration of psychoactive substances results in symptoms of overdose(e.g. coma, life-threatening cardiac or respiratory suppression), it is typically more appropriate toapply a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects of substances in Chapter 22 on injury,poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes rather than substance intoxication.Table 6.15 sets out the disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviouror coordination that are most characteristic of intoxication with each class of psychoactivesubstances in the grouping of disorders due to substance use. These features are caused by theknown pharmacological effects of the substance. Their intensity is closely related to the amount ofthe substance consumed, as well as the route of administration, interaction of the substance withother substances – including medications – and the duration of action of the substance. They aretime-limited, and abate as the substance is cleared from the body.Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours 475Table 6.15.

311,6C50.0,"Gambling disorder, predominantly offline","!markdown
Gambling disorder, predominantly offline is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gambling behaviour that is not primarily conducted over the internet and is manifested by: 

1. impaired control over gambling (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context)~ 
2. increasing priority given to gambling to the extent that gambling takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities~ and

Individualswho steal for monetary gain due to the financial implications of their substance use orgambling should not be diagnosed with kleptomania.Course features• The course of kleptomania is variable, and may take different forms: sporadic, with longperiods of remission between brief episodes; episodic, with lengthy periods of stealingfollowed by periods of remission; or chronic, with fluctuations in intensity.• Treatment-seeking individuals with kleptomania commonly report a long history ofshoplifting (e.g. for more than 10 years) prior to seeking help.Developmental presentations• Onset of kleptomania may occur at any time, but is most common during late adolescence.Onset during late adulthood is rare.Impulse control disorders | Kleptomania Impulse control disorders 525Sex- and/or gender-related features• Women are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with kleptomania.• Gender differences in clinical presentation or severity of symptoms have not been observed.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderIndividuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly children and adolescents– may steal impulsively. However, impulsivity and disregard for consequences in attention deficithyperactivity disorder are typically observed across multiple contexts and situations. Furthermore,individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit tension or affective arousalprior to stealing, and gratification or relief once the theft is committed.Boundary with bipolar type I disorder and schizophrenia and other primarypsychotic disordersStealing may be associated with manic or mixed episodes in individuals with bipolar type I disorder.However, in such cases, stealing does not continue once the mood episode has ended, whereasin individuals with kleptomania stealing is not exclusively associated with mood episodes. Someindividuals with delusions or hallucinations may steal in response to command hallucinationsor in the context of a delusional system, and kleptomania should not be diagnosed in such cases.Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorderStealing in kleptomania can sometimes be described as compulsive by lay people and also bysome health professionals. Compulsions observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almostnever experienced as inherently pleasurable; they typically occur in response to intrusive,unwanted and typically anxiety-provoking obsessions. In contrast, stealing in kleptomania ispreceded by an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal and is followed by an experience ofpleasure, excitement or gratification.Boundary with hoarding disorderSome individuals with hoarding disorder steal objects as part of a pattern of excessive accumulation,and individuals with kleptomania may hoard stolen objects. However, individuals with hoardingdisorder accumulate possessions to the extent that living spaces becoming so cluttered that theiruse or safety is compromised.Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominentdissocial traitsIndividuals with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent dissocialfeatures may commit theft as part of more pervasive pattern of antisocial behaviour, and often fordiscernible motives such as personal gain or revenge rather than to relieve symptoms of tension.Individuals with kleptomania do not exhibit antisocial behaviour other than stealing.Impulse control disorders | Kleptomania 526 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medicationsEpisodes of stealing may occur during substance intoxication. Individuals taking prescribeddopamine agonists – for example, for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome – may exhibitrepetitive stealing behaviour with onset corresponding to use of the medication. Kleptomaniashould not be diagnosed if stealing is better accounted for by intoxication or the disinhibitingeffects of alcohol, drugs or medication. However, among individuals with kleptomania, alcoholand substance use may be associated with acts of theft or attempted theft. The presence of featuresof kleptomania outside of episodes of intoxication is helpful in making this distinction.Boundary with disinhibition in dementia and secondary personality changeSome individuals with dementia or secondary personality change may steal objects as a partof a more general pattern of disinhibition of impulse control due to brain damage. A separatediagnosis of kleptomania should not be assigned in such cases.Boundary with disorders associated with impairment of cognitive or intellectualfunctioningSome individuals with dementia, disorders of intellectual development, or cognitive or intellectualimpairment associated with other conditions may steal objects due to their impaired judgementwithout exhibiting the other features of kleptomania."

322,6C73,Intermittent explosive disorder,"Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by repeated brief episodes of verbal or physical aggression or destruction of property that represent a failure to control aggressive impulses, with the intensity of the outburst or degree of aggressiveness being grossly out of proportion to the provocation or precipitating psychosocial stressors. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not part of a pattern of chronic anger and irritability (e.g., in oppositional defiant disorder). The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.",,Oppositional defiant disorder,"Intermittent explosive disorderEssential (required) features• The presentation is characterized by a pattern of recurrent, brief, explosive episodesinvolving verbal aggression (e.g. verbally attacking another person, temper outbursts,yelling) or physical aggression in an individual who is at least 6 years of age – when inhibitionof angry outbursts is expected to have been attained – or equivalent developmental levelis required for diagnosis. Episodes of physical aggression may result in significant damageor destruction of property or physical assault involving personal injury; however, suchoutcomes are not required for the diagnosis.• The intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly out of proportionto the provocation or precipitating event or situation.Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder Impulse control disorders 531• The explosive outbursts must occur regularly over an extended period of time (e.g. at least3 months), representing a persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour. A lower frequencythreshold (e.g. several times over the course of a year) may be used for high-intensityoutbursts with serious negative consequences, such as physically assaulting another person,whereas a higher frequency threshold (e.g. two or more times per week) should be usedfor episodes characterized by verbal aggression or non-assaultive and non-destructivephysical aggression.• The aggressive behaviours are clearly impulsive or reactive in nature, and represent a failureto control aggressive impulse. That is, the aggressive acts are not planned or instrumentalin achieving a desired outcome.• The frequency and intensity of explosive episodes is outside the limits of normal variationexpected for the individual’s age and developmental level.• The explosive outbursts are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural orneurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder, oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger, conduct-dissocialdisorder, delirium).• The explosive outbursts are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the centralnervous system (e.g. amfetamines), including substance intoxication and withdrawal, ordue to a disease of the nervous system.• The behaviour pattern results in significant distress for the individual with the disorder,or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning.Additional clinical features• Explosive episodes may be associated with affective symptoms (anger, irritability,rage) during aggressive outbursts. Sometimes the aggressive episodes are preceded bypremonitory symptoms such as tremor or chest tightness, or a more general feeling oftension or arousal.• Explosive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are typically triggered by perceivedthreats in social settings (even when there is no real threat but, for example, threat isperceived based on an inaccurate attribution of hostility to others), or by frustration whenfacing obstacles in the course of daily life.• A wide array of aggressive behaviours could fulfil the requirements for intermittentexplosive disorder, ranging from verbal aggression to physical assault and destructionof property.• After the explosive episode, the individual often, but not always, experiences depressedmood or fatigue, or other negative emotions such as regret, remorse, guilt or shame.• Some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder exhibit nonspecific abnormalitieson neurological examination (e.g. soft signs) and in EEGs that do not constitute adiagnosable disease of the nervous system. In the presence of such findings, intermittentexplosive disorder may still be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements are met.• Many individuals with intermittent explosive disorder have a history of exposure totraumatic events, witnessing violence, or childhood physical abuse.• Intermittent explosive disorder often co-occurs with depressive disorders, anxiety andfear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and eating disorders (especiallythose involving binge eating).Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder 532 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with normality (threshold)• Aggressive outbursts – particularly verbal ones – are common, especially when anindividual is under stress, and are not in themselves indicative of psychopathology. Themere occurrence of one or two isolated explosive episodes is not sufficient for the diagnosis,regardless of the severity or consequences of the behaviour. This diagnosis should only beconsidered when the intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grosslyout of proportion to the provocation or precipitating event or situation, and the outburstsoccur regularly over an extended period of time, representing a persistent pattern ofaggressive behaviour.Course features• The mean age of onset of intermittent explosive disorder is between 10 and 16 years. Age ofonset is typically earlier than common co-occurring disorders such as depressive disorders,anxiety and fear-related disorders, eating disorders and disorders due to substance use.• Intermittent explosive disorder tends to exhibit a persistent course over many years.Aggressive behaviour in general tends to diminish over time, and the prevalence ofintermittent explosive disorder correspondingly diminishes over the lifespan.Developmental presentations• Early in the course of intermittent explosive disorder, children typically display tempertantrums associated with verbal outbursts and aggression against objects, althoughtypically without serious destruction of objects or assault against others.• During adolescence, explosive outbursts often escalate to include destruction of objects orproperty, or physical assault against others.Culture-related features• Variation in prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder may be related to cultural normsregarding emotion regulation. Some cultures emphasize emotional restraint, equanimity,interpersonal harmony and social conformity such that individuals suppress or mute overtexpressions of hostility or anger. In other cultures, freer expressions of negative affectare more typical. Whether or not a verbal expression is considered aggressive should beevaluated within the context of what is normative within the individual’s culture.Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder Impulse control disorders 533• Societies vary in the degree to which they consider anger a harmful emotion, associatedwith substantial personal and social risk. Some cultural concepts of distress are attributedto pent-up anger, such as ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) in Latin America and hwa-byung (anger illness) in the Republic of Korea. It may be appropriate to apply a diagnosis ofintermittent explosive disorder to some behavioural patterns of ataque de nervios involvingparoxysmal violence and destruction of property.• The typical level of expressed emotionality varies cross-culturally, including by gender andage. Cultural minorities, immigrants or individuals in post-conflict settings may be at riskof being mislabelled as excessively angry because of this variation. Moreover, clinicians maymisattribute anger to a single triggering event when it is in reaction to the accumulation ofmultiple environmental stressors (e.g. discrimination, losses, displacement, limited socialsupport, powerlessness, injustice). Clinicians should consider the larger social context andhow it may be related to the expression of anger before assigning a diagnosis.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although it was originally believed that intermittent explosive disorder was much moreprevalent among males, recent community surveys suggest similar prevalence rates bygender. However, serious physical assault is a more common manifestation of the disorderin males, whereas less serious physical and verbal aggression is more characteristicof females.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with autism spectrum disorderExplosive outbursts with aggressive behaviours may occur in some individuals with autismspectrum disorder. These outbursts are usually associated with a specific trigger that is related to thecore symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (e.g. a change in routine, aversive sensory stimulation,anxiety, rigidity when the individual’s thoughts or behaviours are interrupted). Individuals withintermittent explosive disorder do not exhibit other features of social communication difficultiesand restricted or repetitive behaviours that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderIntermittent explosive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are both characterizedby impulsive behaviour. However, intermittent explosive disorder is specifically characterized byintermittent severe aggressive outbursts rather than ongoing generalized behavioural impulsivitythat may be seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Both diagnoses may be assigned if thefull diagnostic requirements for each are met.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderRegularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity orduration to the provocation may also occur in the context of oppositional defiant disorder withchronic irritability-anger, particularly in response to demands by authority figures. In such cases,Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder 534 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersan additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be assigned. Individualswith oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other featuresof oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, whichare not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with intermittentexplosive disorder are more likely to exhibit significant physical aggression.Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorderPeople with intermittent explosive disorder may come into conflict with other people and withlaw enforcement because of their explosive outbursts, but these episodes do not constitute amore general pattern of antisocial behaviour characteristic of conduct-dissocial disorder (e.g.rule violations, lying, theft). In addition, intermittent explosive disorder is characterized byimpulsive aggression, while aggression in conduct-dissocial disorder is often premeditated andinstrumental.Boundary with personality disorderDue to interpersonal, occupational and other consequences of a recurrent pattern of verbal andphysical aggression, some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder are likely to meet thediagnostic requirements for personality disorder with prominent features of disinhibition. Bothdiagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, but the utility ofassigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in such cases depends on the specificclinical situation.Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disordersAggressive outbursts may occur as a part of a number of mental disorders (e.g. disordersspecifically associated with stress, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other primary psychoticdisorders). In general, an additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not begiven when the outbursts are better accounted for by another disorder.Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medicationsExplosive aggressive behaviours may occur during substance intoxication or withdrawal.Intermittent explosive disorder should not be diagnosed if the outbursts are solely attributableto intoxication or the disinhibiting effects of alcohol, drugs or medication. However, amongindividuals with intermittent explosive disorder, alcohol and substance use are commonlyassociated with episodes of aggressive behaviour. In these situations, the distinction should bemade based on the presence of features of intermittent explosive disorder at times other thanduring episodes of intoxication.Boundary with malingeringSome individuals who engage in recurrent acts of verbal or physical aggression may falselyreport additional symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder, withthe intent of obtaining a mental disorder diagnosis to avoid criminal charges or other negativeconsequences. Intermittent explosive disorder should not be diagnosed in such cases.Boundary with dementia and other medical conditionsThe diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be assigned when the impulsiveaggressive behaviours are entirely explained by dementia, a disease of the nervous system –including stroke – or another medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural andneurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. a brain tumour).Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder Impulse control disorders 535",Intermittent explosive disorder,"Disorder Name: Intermittent explosive disorderDisorder Code: 6C73Disorder symptoms: Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by repeated brief episodes of verbal or physical aggression or destruction of property that represent a failure to control aggressive impulses, with the intensity of the outburst or degree of aggressiveness being grossly out of proportion to the provocation or precipitating psychosocial stressors. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not part of a pattern of chronic anger and irritability (e.g., in oppositional defiant disorder). The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.If you diagnose this disease exclude: Oppositional defiant disorderIntermittent explosive disorderEssential (required) features• The presentation is characterized by a pattern of recurrent, brief, explosive episodesinvolving verbal aggression (e.g. verbally attacking another person, temper outbursts,yelling) or physical aggression in an individual who is at least 6 years of age – when inhibitionof angry outbursts is expected to have been attained – or equivalent developmental levelis required for diagnosis. Episodes of physical aggression may result in significant damageor destruction of property or physical assault involving personal injury; however, suchoutcomes are not required for the diagnosis.• The intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly out of proportionto the provocation or precipitating event or situation.Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder Impulse control disorders 531• The explosive outbursts must occur regularly over an extended period of time (e.g. at least3 months), representing a persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour. A lower frequencythreshold (e.g. several times over the course of a year) may be used for high-intensityoutbursts with serious negative consequences, such as physically assaulting another person,whereas a higher frequency threshold (e.g. two or more times per week) should be usedfor episodes characterized by verbal aggression or non-assaultive and non-destructivephysical aggression.• The aggressive behaviours are clearly impulsive or reactive in nature, and represent a failureto control aggressive impulse. That is, the aggressive acts are not planned or instrumentalin achieving a desired outcome.• The frequency and intensity of explosive episodes is outside the limits of normal variationexpected for the individual’s age and developmental level.• The explosive outbursts are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural orneurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder, oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger, conduct-dissocialdisorder, delirium).• The explosive outbursts are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the centralnervous system (e.g. amfetamines), including substance intoxication and withdrawal, ordue to a disease of the nervous system.• The behaviour pattern results in significant distress for the individual with the disorder,or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or otherimportant areas of functioning.Additional clinical features• Explosive episodes may be associated with affective symptoms (anger, irritability,rage) during aggressive outbursts. Sometimes the aggressive episodes are preceded bypremonitory symptoms such as tremor or chest tightness, or a more general feeling oftension or arousal.• Explosive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are typically triggered by perceivedthreats in social settings (even when there is no real threat but, for example, threat isperceived based on an inaccurate attribution of hostility to others), or by frustration whenfacing obstacles in the course of daily life.• A wide array of aggressive behaviours could fulfil the requirements for intermittentexplosive disorder, ranging from verbal aggression to physical assault and destructionof property.• After the explosive episode, the individual often, but not always, experiences depressedmood or fatigue, or other negative emotions such as regret, remorse, guilt or shame.• Some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder exhibit nonspecific abnormalitieson neurological examination (e.g. soft signs) and in EEGs that do not constitute adiagnosable disease of the nervous system. In the presence of such findings, intermittentexplosive disorder may still be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements are met.• Many individuals with intermittent explosive disorder have a history of exposure totraumatic events, witnessing violence, or childhood physical abuse.• Intermittent explosive disorder often co-occurs with depressive disorders, anxiety andfear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and eating disorders (especiallythose involving binge eating).Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder 532 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with normality (threshold)• Aggressive outbursts – particularly verbal ones – are common, especially when anindividual is under stress, and are not in themselves indicative of psychopathology. Themere occurrence of one or two isolated explosive episodes is not sufficient for the diagnosis,regardless of the severity or consequences of the behaviour. This diagnosis should only beconsidered when the intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grosslyout of proportion to the provocation or precipitating event or situation, and the outburstsoccur regularly over an extended period of time, representing a persistent pattern ofaggressive behaviour.Course features• The mean age of onset of intermittent explosive disorder is between 10 and 16 years. Age ofonset is typically earlier than common co-occurring disorders such as depressive disorders,anxiety and fear-related disorders, eating disorders and disorders due to substance use.• Intermittent explosive disorder tends to exhibit a persistent course over many years.Aggressive behaviour in general tends to diminish over time, and the prevalence ofintermittent explosive disorder correspondingly diminishes over the lifespan.Developmental presentations• Early in the course of intermittent explosive disorder, children typically display tempertantrums associated with verbal outbursts and aggression against objects, althoughtypically without serious destruction of objects or assault against others.• During adolescence, explosive outbursts often escalate to include destruction of objects orproperty, or physical assault against others.Culture-related features• Variation in prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder may be related to cultural normsregarding emotion regulation. Some cultures emphasize emotional restraint, equanimity,interpersonal harmony and social conformity such that individuals suppress or mute overtexpressions of hostility or anger. In other cultures, freer expressions of negative affectare more typical. Whether or not a verbal expression is considered aggressive should beevaluated within the context of what is normative within the individual’s culture.Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder Impulse control disorders 533• Societies vary in the degree to which they consider anger a harmful emotion, associatedwith substantial personal and social risk. Some cultural concepts of distress are attributedto pent-up anger, such as ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) in Latin America and hwa-byung (anger illness) in the Republic of Korea. It may be appropriate to apply a diagnosis ofintermittent explosive disorder to some behavioural patterns of ataque de nervios involvingparoxysmal violence and destruction of property.• The typical level of expressed emotionality varies cross-culturally, including by gender andage. Cultural minorities, immigrants or individuals in post-conflict settings may be at riskof being mislabelled as excessively angry because of this variation. Moreover, clinicians maymisattribute anger to a single triggering event when it is in reaction to the accumulation ofmultiple environmental stressors (e.g. discrimination, losses, displacement, limited socialsupport, powerlessness, injustice). Clinicians should consider the larger social context andhow it may be related to the expression of anger before assigning a diagnosis.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Although it was originally believed that intermittent explosive disorder was much moreprevalent among males, recent community surveys suggest similar prevalence rates bygender. However, serious physical assault is a more common manifestation of the disorderin males, whereas less serious physical and verbal aggression is more characteristicof females.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with autism spectrum disorderExplosive outbursts with aggressive behaviours may occur in some individuals with autismspectrum disorder. These outbursts are usually associated with a specific trigger that is related to thecore symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (e.g. a change in routine, aversive sensory stimulation,anxiety, rigidity when the individual’s thoughts or behaviours are interrupted). Individuals withintermittent explosive disorder do not exhibit other features of social communication difficultiesand restricted or repetitive behaviours that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderIntermittent explosive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are both characterizedby impulsive behaviour. However, intermittent explosive disorder is specifically characterized byintermittent severe aggressive outbursts rather than ongoing generalized behavioural impulsivitythat may be seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Both diagnoses may be assigned if thefull diagnostic requirements for each are met.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderRegularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity orduration to the provocation may also occur in the context of oppositional defiant disorder withchronic irritability-anger, particularly in response to demands by authority figures. In such cases,Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder 534 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersan additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be assigned. Individualswith oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other featuresof oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, whichare not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with intermittentexplosive disorder are more likely to exhibit significant physical aggression.Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorderPeople with intermittent explosive disorder may come into conflict with other people and withlaw enforcement because of their explosive outbursts, but these episodes do not constitute amore general pattern of antisocial behaviour characteristic of conduct-dissocial disorder (e.g.rule violations, lying, theft). In addition, intermittent explosive disorder is characterized byimpulsive aggression, while aggression in conduct-dissocial disorder is often premeditated andinstrumental.Boundary with personality disorderDue to interpersonal, occupational and other consequences of a recurrent pattern of verbal andphysical aggression, some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder are likely to meet thediagnostic requirements for personality disorder with prominent features of disinhibition. Bothdiagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, but the utility ofassigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in such cases depends on the specificclinical situation.Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disordersAggressive outbursts may occur as a part of a number of mental disorders (e.g. disordersspecifically associated with stress, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other primary psychoticdisorders). In general, an additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not begiven when the outbursts are better accounted for by another disorder.Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medicationsExplosive aggressive behaviours may occur during substance intoxication or withdrawal.Intermittent explosive disorder should not be diagnosed if the outbursts are solely attributableto intoxication or the disinhibiting effects of alcohol, drugs or medication. However, amongindividuals with intermittent explosive disorder, alcohol and substance use are commonlyassociated with episodes of aggressive behaviour. In these situations, the distinction should bemade based on the presence of features of intermittent explosive disorder at times other thanduring episodes of intoxication.Boundary with malingeringSome individuals who engage in recurrent acts of verbal or physical aggression may falselyreport additional symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder, withthe intent of obtaining a mental disorder diagnosis to avoid criminal charges or other negativeconsequences.

Oppositional defiant disorder isassociated with peer rejection and interpersonal discord through the school years and intoadulthood.• Frequently, the oppositional defiant features have a provocative quality, such thatindividuals initiate confrontations and may be seen as excessively rude and uncooperative.• Younger children (e.g. 3–5 years of age) are typically more closely supervised, and receivefrequent instructions and limits imposed on them by authority figures (e.g. parents orother guardians, caregivers, teachers). As children grow older, direct demands by authorityfigures typically become less frequent. Moreover, others interacting with children oradolescents with oppositional defiant disorder may come to avoid placing demands onthem due to their negative response. Therefore, a diagnosis is not precluded becauseoppositional or defiant behaviours occur relatively infrequently, as long as they characterizemost interactions with authority figures.• Adults with oppositional defiant disorder continue to experience conflictual relationshipswith parents and family members, and have generally poorer social support networks.This affects the number and quality of their friendships and romantic relationships. Theytypically struggle to function in the workplace due to difficulties in their interactions withsupervisors and co-workers.• Features of irritability and anger (e.g. being touchy or easily annoyed, losing temper,being angry and resentful) are sometimes the predominant characteristics of the clinicalpresentation. However, irritability and anger alone are neither necessary nor sufficientfor the diagnosis. These symptoms must be accompanied by a pattern of markedlynoncompliant, defiant and disobedient behaviour that is atypical for individuals ofcomparable age and developmental level. The presence of chronic irritability-anger isindicated using the corresponding specifier.• Oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger is not necessarily moresevere or rare than oppositional defiant disorder without chronic irritability-anger. Rather,oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger identifies a pattern of mooddysregulation that can range in severity from frequent and impairing tantrums to extremepresentations of the mood dysregulation.• Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder may present with limited prosocialemotions. When assessing for oppositional defiant disorder, the clinician should also assessfor limited prosocial emotions; if present, the appropriate specifier should be assigned (seep. 548). Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder with limited prosocial emotions aremore likely to exhibit a more persistent and severe pattern of antisocial behaviour that maysubsequently meet the diagnostic requirements for conduct-dissocial disorder.• Oppositional defiant disorder in childhood frequently co-occurs with attention deficithyperactivity disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder, and internalizing disorders such asdepressive disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders.Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders 541Boundary with normality (threshold)• Transient noncompliance, defiance and disobedience including irritability or anger canoccur within the normal range of behaviour as a part of typical development, or in responseto increased demands on the developing child or changes in the child’s environment(e.g. transition to a new school or city), or as a manifestation of normative anxiety in thecontext of specific tasks or situations (e.g. going to school and separating from parentsfor the first time). The presence of such behaviours should not be taken as evidence fora presumptive diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Oppositional defiant disordershould only be diagnosed when there is a persistent pattern of markedly noncompliant,defiant and disobedient behaviour that is atypical considering the individual’s age, genderand sociocultural context.Course features• The heterogeneity of presentations in oppositional defiant disorder has meaningful clinicaland prognostic implications. Oppositional defiant disorder can be a developmentalprecursor for the development of conduct-dissocial disorder, especially when thepresentation of oppositional defiant disorder includes severely defiant or spiteful/vindictive behaviours. However, many children with oppositional defiant disorder do notsubsequently develop conduct-dissocial disorder.• A diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger is associatedwith the subsequent development of depressive disorders and anxiety andfear-related disorders.Developmental presentations• Typical age of onset of oppositional defiant disorder is in middle childhood, with initialsymptoms typically appearing at preschool age. Symptoms rarely emerge for the first timelater than early adolescence.• Prevalence rates of oppositional defiant disorder are estimated at 3.3% among childrenand adolescents (aged 6–18 years). Some evidence suggests that overall prevalence ofoppositional defiant disorder decreases beginning in adolescence and young adulthood.• Oppositional defiant disorder is more common among children and adolescents whosefamilies have experienced substantial disruptions in caregiving relationships, or in whichparenting practices tend to be harsh, inconsistent or neglectful.• Although oppositional and argumentative behaviours are common in typically developingchildren, unlike in oppositional defiant disorder, these behaviours tend to be transient anddo not consistently negatively affect the child’s functioning and development.Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder 542 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with greater peer rejection, heightenedinterpersonal conflict, and increased risk of co-occurring and subsequent difficulties inadjustment throughout childhood and adulthood.Culture-related features• There is substantial variation in the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder acrosscultures. These differences may be related to cultural norms regarding uncooperative ordefiant behaviour in children. For example, cultures that value obedience highly mayhave a lower threshold for considering a child’s behaviour to be noncompliant, defiantor disobedient. The behaviours relevant to assigning a diagnosis of oppositional defiantdisorder should be evaluated in relation to social, cultural and subgroup norms.• Variation in the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorderacross cultural groups may be related to differences in family structure and behaviour.Lower prevalence may be associated with stricter disciplinary practices at home, strongemphasis on educational or occupational attainment, and cultural values that disapproveof an antisocial lifestyle.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder is higher among school-aged boys than school-aged girls, but does not appear to differ by gender at other points across the lifespan.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorderThe behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant disorder are largely characterized byinterpersonal conflict with authority figures and difficulty getting along with others. In contrast,conduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of more severeand dissocial behaviour, in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social orcultural norms, rules or laws are violated (e.g. aggression towards people or animals, destructionof property, deceitfulness or theft, serious violations of rules). However, individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder often demonstrate a range or history of behaviour problems that may includethe interpersonal difficulties characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder. Both diagnoses maybe assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorderIndividuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have difficulty following directions,complying with rules and getting along with others. When these disruptive behaviours areDisruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders 543better accounted for by inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (e.g. failure to follow long andcomplicated directions, difficulty remaining seated or staying on task when asked), oppositionaldefiant disorder should not be diagnosed. In oppositional defiant disorder, the pattern ofnoncompliance is characterized by disobedience, beyond problems with attention and behaviouralinhibition. However, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disordercommonly co-occur and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements foreach are met.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderNoncompliant and other disruptive behaviours characteristic of oppositional defiant disordershould be distinguished from behaviour problems that are common among individuals withautism spectrum disorder. The key difference is that, in autism spectrum disorder, disruptivebehaviours are often associated with specific environmental factors (e.g. sudden change in routine,aversive sensory stimulation), or the noncompliance is a consequence of the core symptoms ofthat disorder (e.g. social communication deficits, restricted, repetitive, inflexible patterns ofbehaviour, sensory sensitivities) rather than reflecting an intention to be provocative or spiteful.Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder do not typically exhibit the social communicationdeficits and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities thatare characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.Boundary with mood disordersIt is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance andsymptoms of irritability/anger to occur as a feature of a mood episode. Specifically, noncompliancemay result from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure inactivities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy).During manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes, individuals are less likely to follow rules andcomply with directions. Moreover, in children and adolescents, depressive, manic or hypomanicmood can manifest as irritability. When the behaviour problems occur entirely in the context ofmood episodes, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned.Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disordersIn children and adolescents, symptoms of anxiety and fear-related disorders can sometimesmanifest as noncompliance, defiance and disobedience, including irritability or anger. Forexample, children may exhibit angry outbursts and refuse to comply with requests whenpresented with a task or a situation that makes them feel anxious (e.g. when a child with socialanxiety disorder is asked to make a presentation in class). These behaviours are typically amanifestation of a desire on the part of the child or adolescent to avoid the feared situation orstimulus. Furthermore, children and adolescents with anxiety and fear-related disorders do nottypically exhibit provocative, spiteful or vindictive behaviour. If the defiant behaviour occurs onlyin response to situations or stimuli that elicit anxiety, fear or panic, oppositional defiant disordershould not be diagnosed.Boundary with intermittent explosive disorderRegularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity orduration to the provocation are the core symptom of intermittent explosive disorder but may alsooccur in the context of oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger. Individualswith oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other featuresof oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, whichare not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder.

In oppositional defiant disorder, the pattern ofnoncompliance is characterized by disobedience, beyond problems with attention and behaviouralinhibition. However, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disordercommonly co-occur and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements foreach are met.Boundary with autism spectrum disorderNoncompliant and other disruptive behaviours characteristic of oppositional defiant disordershould be distinguished from behaviour problems that are common among individuals withautism spectrum disorder. The key difference is that, in autism spectrum disorder, disruptivebehaviours are often associated with specific environmental factors (e.g. sudden change in routine,aversive sensory stimulation), or the noncompliance is a consequence of the core symptoms ofthat disorder (e.g. social communication deficits, restricted, repetitive, inflexible patterns ofbehaviour, sensory sensitivities) rather than reflecting an intention to be provocative or spiteful.Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder do not typically exhibit the social communicationdeficits and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities thatare characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.Boundary with mood disordersIt is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance andsymptoms of irritability/anger to occur as a feature of a mood episode. Specifically, noncompliancemay result from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure inactivities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy).During manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes, individuals are less likely to follow rules andcomply with directions. Moreover, in children and adolescents, depressive, manic or hypomanicmood can manifest as irritability. When the behaviour problems occur entirely in the context ofmood episodes, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned.Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disordersIn children and adolescents, symptoms of anxiety and fear-related disorders can sometimesmanifest as noncompliance, defiance and disobedience, including irritability or anger. Forexample, children may exhibit angry outbursts and refuse to comply with requests whenpresented with a task or a situation that makes them feel anxious (e.g. when a child with socialanxiety disorder is asked to make a presentation in class). These behaviours are typically amanifestation of a desire on the part of the child or adolescent to avoid the feared situation orstimulus. Furthermore, children and adolescents with anxiety and fear-related disorders do nottypically exhibit provocative, spiteful or vindictive behaviour. If the defiant behaviour occurs onlyin response to situations or stimuli that elicit anxiety, fear or panic, oppositional defiant disordershould not be diagnosed.Boundary with intermittent explosive disorderRegularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity orduration to the provocation are the core symptom of intermittent explosive disorder but may alsooccur in the context of oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger. Individualswith oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other featuresof oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, whichare not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with intermittentexplosive disorder are more likely to exhibit significant physical aggression.Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder 544 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders"

In this way,the trait is strongly associated with such behaviours as substance use, gambling and impulsivesexual activity.DistractibilityIndividuals with prominent disinhibition also have difficulty staying focused on important andnecessary tasks that require sustained effort. They quickly become bored or frustrated withdifficult, routine or tedious tasks, and are easily distracted by extraneous stimuli, such as others’conversations. Even in the absence of distractions, they have difficulty keeping their attentionfocused and persisting on tasks, and tend to scan the environment for more enjoyable options.IrresponsibilityIndividuals with prominent disinhibition are unreliable and lack a sense of accountability fortheir actions. As a result, they often do not complete work assignments or perform expectedduties; they fail to meet deadlines, do not follow through on commitments and promises, and arelate to or miss formal and informal appointments and meetings because they allow themselves tobecome engaged in something more compelling that has caught their attention.RecklessnessIndividuals with prominent disinhibition lack an appropriate sense of caution. They tend tooverestimate their abilities and thus frequently do things that are beyond their skill level, withoutconsidering potential safety risks. Individuals with prominent disinhibition may engage in recklessdriving or dangerous sports, or perform other activities that put them or others in physical dangerwithout sufficient preparation or training.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder Personality disorders and related traits 563Lack of planningIndividuals with prominent disinhibition prefer spontaneous over planned activities, leavingtheir options open should a more attractive opportunity arise. They tend to focus on immediatefeelings, sensations and thoughts, with relatively little attention paid to longer-term or even short-term goals. When they do make plans, they often fail to follow through on them, so they areseldom able to reach long-term goals, and often fail to achieve even short-term goals."

Thus, early life adversity is a risk factor for later development of personalitydisorder, as it is for many other mental disorders. However, it is not determinative: someindividuals’ temperament allows typical personality development despite an extremelyadverse early environment. Nonetheless, in the context of a history of early adversity,ongoing behavioural, emotional or interpersonal difficulties suggest that a personalitydisorder diagnosis should be considered.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder Personality disorders and related traits 565• Personality disorder often complicates and lengthens treatment of other clinicalsyndromes. Thus, poor or incomplete response to standard treatments of, for example,depressive disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders may suggest the presence ofpersonality disorder. Relatedly, persistent functional impairment after resolution of theclinical syndrome(s) being treated may suggest the presence of personality disorder.• There is often considerable variability in the degree to which individuals and thosearound them agree that the individual’s behaviours reflect a particular trait. If there is amarked discrepancy between an individual’s self-description and the kinds of problematicbehaviours exhibited, it often is helpful to interview someone who knows the personwell. Marked differences between the individual’s self-description and the informant’sdescription may be suggestive of personality disorder.Boundary with normality (threshold) for personality disorder• Personality refers to an individual’s characteristic way of behaving and experiencinglife, and of perceiving and interpreting themselves, other people, events and situations.Personality is manifested most directly in how individuals think and feel about themselvesand their interpersonal relationships, how they behave in response to those thoughts andfeelings and in response to others’ behaviours, and how they react to events in their lives andchanges in the environment. An important characteristic of non-disordered personality issufficient flexibility to react appropriately and to adapt to other people’s behaviours, lifeevents and changes in the environment. In personality disorder, patterns of cognition,emotional experience, emotional expression and behaviour are sufficiently maladaptive(e.g. inflexible or poorly regulated) that they result in substantial distress or significantimpairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areasof functioning.• To warrant a diagnosis of personality disorder, personality disturbance must be manifestedacross a range of personal and social situations over an extended period of time (e.g.lasting 2 years or more). Behaviour patterns that are apparent only in the context ofspecific relationships, social roles or environmental circumstances, or that have lasted fora shorter period of time, are not a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of personality disorder.Instead, the possibility that such behaviour patterns are a response to environmentalcircumstances must be considered. A focus on problems in the relevant relationship or inthe environment (e.g. with family or school) may be more appropriate than a diagnosis ofpersonality disorder in such cases.Course features• Manifestations of personality disturbance tend to appear first in childhood, increaseduring adolescence, and continue into adulthood, although individuals may not come toclinical attention until later in life. Caution should be exercised in applying the diagnosisto children because their personalities are still developing.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder 566 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders• Overt behavioural manifestations of certain traits (dissociality, disinhibition) tend todecline over the course of adulthood. Other traits (detachment, anankastia) are less likelyto do so. In both cases, functional impairment in broad areas of life (e.g. employment,interpersonal relationships) among people with personality disorder is often persistent.• Personality disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but may change such thata person who had personality disorder during young adulthood no longer meets thediagnostic requirements by middle age.• Much less commonly, a person who earlier did not have a diagnosable personality disorderdevelops one later in life. Emergence of personality disorder in older adults may be relatedto the loss of social support that had previously helped to compensate for personalitydisturbance.• When there is a change in personality during middle adulthood or later in life, in theabsence of change in the individual’s environment, the possibility that the change is due toan underlying medical condition (e.g. secondary personality change) or to an unrecognizeddisorder due to substance use should be considered.Developmental presentations• Personality disorder is not typically diagnosed in pre-adolescent children. Over the courseof their development, children integrate knowledge and experience about themselves andother people into a coherent identity and sense of self, as well as into individual stylesof interacting with others. Different children vary substantially in the rate at which thisintegration occurs, and there is also substantial variation in the rate of integration withinindividuals over time. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine whether a pre-adolescentchild exhibits problems in functioning in aspects of the self, such as identity, self-worth,accuracy of self-view or self-direction, because these functions are not fully developedin children. This is also true of interpersonal functions such as the ability to understandothers’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships.• However, prominent maladaptive traits may be observable in pre-adolescent childrenand may be precursors to personality disorder in adolescence and adulthood. Forexample, individual differences in negative affectivity and disinhibition, as well as morespecific features such as lack of empathy (an aspect of dissociality) and perfectionism (anaspect of anankastia) may be observed in very young children. However, such traits arealso associated with the development of other mental disorders (e.g. mood disorders,anxiety and fear-related disorders) and should not be interpreted as childhood forms ofpersonality disorder.• Features of personality disorder manifest in similar ways in adolescents and in adults.However, in evaluating adolescents, it is important to consider the developmentaltypicality of the relevant behaviour patterns. For example, risk-taking behaviour, self-harm and moodiness are more common during adolescence than during adulthood.Therefore, thresholds for evaluating whether such behaviour patterns are indicative ofpersonality disorder or of elevations in trait domains such as disinhibition and negativeaffectivity among adolescents should be correspondingly higher. The wide variability innormal adolescent development that may affect the expression of these behaviours orcharacteristics should also be considered.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder Personality disorders and related traits 567Culture-related features• Assessment of personality across cultures is challenging, requiring knowledge of normativepersonality function for the sociocultural context, variations in cultural concepts of the self,and evidence for consistent traits and behaviours across time and multiple social contexts.• Culture shapes modes of self-construal, social presentation and levels of insight aboutbehaviours that are related to personality development, including what are considerednormal and abnormal personality states in a given setting. For example, children reared incollectivist societies may develop attachment styles and traits that are viewed as dependentor avoidant related to the norms of more individualistic cultures. In turn, traits of self-involvement that are accepted or positively valued in individualistic cultures may beconsidered narcissistic in collectivist cultures.• Diagnosis of personality disorder must take into account the person’s cultural background.Collateral information may be needed to assess whether certain disruptive self-statesand behaviours are considered culturally uncharacteristic and therefore consistent withpersonality disorder in a given culture. In general, a diagnosis of personality disordershould be assigned only when the symptoms exceed thresholds that are normative for thesociocultural context.• Among ethnic minority, immigrant and refugee communities, responses to discrimination,social exclusion and acculturative stress may be confused with personality disorder. Forexample, suspiciousness or mistrust may be common in situations of endemic racism anddiscrimination.• Sociocultural contexts of exclusion affecting marginal social groups can evoke repeatedattempts at self-affirmation or acceptance by others that are based on ambiguous ortroubled relationships with authority figures and limited adaptability. These reactions maybe confounded with manifestations of borderline pattern, such as impulsivity, instability,affective lability, explosive/aggressive behaviour or dissociative symptoms. However,a diagnosis should be assigned only when the symptoms exceed thresholds that arenormative for the sociocultural context.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Available evidence indicates that gender distribution of personality disorder isapproximately equal. However, there are significant gender differences in the behaviouralexpression of personality disorder and in the associated trait domains. Specifically,elevations on dissociality and disinhibition are more common among men, and elevationson negative affectivity are more common among women.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder 568 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with personality difficultyIndividuals with pronounced personality characteristics that do not rise to the level of severity tomerit a diagnosis of personality disorder may be considered to have personality difficulty if thecharacteristics affect treatment or health services. In contrast to personality disorder, personalitydifficulty is manifested only intermittently (e.g. during times of stress) or at low intensity. Thedifficulties are associated with some problems in functioning, but these are insufficiently severeto cause notable disruption in social, occupational and interpersonal relationships, and may belimited to specific relationships or situations.Boundary with persistent mental disordersA number of persistent and enduring mental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, schizotypaldisorder, dysthymic disorder, cyclothymic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder) arecharacterized by enduring disturbances in cognition, emotional experience and behaviour thatare maladaptive, manifested across a range of personal and social situations, and are associatedwith significant problems in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g. self-esteem, self-direction) and/or interpersonal dysfunction (e.g. ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfyingrelationships, ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships).Accordingly, individuals with these disorders may also meet the diagnostic requirements forpersonality disorder. Generally, individuals with such disorders should not be given an additionaldiagnosis of personality disorder unless additional personality features are present that contributeto significant problems in functioning of aspects of the self or interpersonal functioning. However,even in the absence of these additional features, there may be specific situations in which anadditional diagnosis of personality disorder is warranted (e.g. entry into clinically indicatedforms of treatment that are connected to a personality disorder diagnosis).Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotionsConduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a recurrent pattern of behaviour in whichthe basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules or laws areviolated; this may range in duration from a discrete period lasting a number of months to onethat persists across the lifespan. Conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions isfurther characterized by limited or absent empathy or sensitivity to others’ feelings, and limitedor absent remorse, shame or guilt. Conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotionshas features in common with personality disorder with dissociality, which is characterized bydisregard for the rights and feelings of other, self-centredness and lack of empathy. Conduct-dissocial disorder may be diagnosed among pre-adolescent children, based on a shorter durationof symptoms than personality disorder. Among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, anadditional diagnosis of personality disorder is warranted only if there are personality features inaddition to dissociality that contribute to significant impairments in functioning of aspects of theself or problems in interpersonal functioning.Boundary with secondary personality changeSecondary personality change is a persistent personality disturbance that represents a changefrom the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern that is judged to be a directpathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under mental, behaviouralPersonality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder Personality disorders and related traits 569and neurodevelopmental disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examinationor laboratory findings. Personality disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are due to anothermedical condition.Boundary with disorders due to substance useDisorders due to substance use often have pervasive effects on functioning of the self andinterpersonal functioning. For example, they may exhibit problems with self-direction and self-esteem, difficulties and conflicts in relationships, dissocial behaviour related to obtaining or usingdrugs, and a wide range of other features that are commonly seen in individuals with personalitydisorder. If the personality disturbance is entirely accounted for by a disorder due to substance use,a diagnosis of personality disorder should not be given. However, if the personality disturbance isnot entirely accounted for by the disorder due to substance use (e.g. if the personality disturbancepreceded the onset of substance use) or if there are features of a personality disorder that arenot accounted for by substance use (e.g. perfectionism), an additional diagnosis of personalitydisorder may be assigned.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder 570 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Paraphilic disorders 571Paraphilic disordersParaphilic disorders are characterized by persistent and intense patterns of atypical sexual arousal,manifested in sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours, in which the focus of the arousalpattern involves others whose age or status renders them unwilling or unable to consent (e.g.pre-pubertal children, an unsuspecting individual being viewed through a window, an animal).Paraphilic disorders may also involve other atypical sexual arousal patterns if they cause markeddistress to the individual, or may involve significant risk of injury or death.Paraphilic disorders include the following:",Borderline pattern,"Disorder Name: Borderline patternDisorder Code: 6D11.5Disorder symptoms: The Borderline pattern specifier may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterised by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, as indicated by many of the following: Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment~ A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships~ Identity disturbance, manifested in markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self~ A tendency to act rashly in states of high negative affect, leading to potentially self-damaging behaviours~ Recurrent episodes of self-harm~ Emotional instability due to marked reactivity of mood~ Chronic feelings of emptiness~ Inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger~ Transient dissociative symptoms or psychotic-like features in situations of high affective arousal.Borderline patternNote: the borderline pattern specifier has been included to enhance the clinical utility ofthe classification of personality disorder.

Thedifficulties are associated with some problems in functioning, but these are insufficiently severeto cause notable disruption in social, occupational and interpersonal relationships, and may belimited to specific relationships or situations.Boundary with persistent mental disordersA number of persistent and enduring mental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, schizotypaldisorder, dysthymic disorder, cyclothymic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder) arecharacterized by enduring disturbances in cognition, emotional experience and behaviour thatare maladaptive, manifested across a range of personal and social situations, and are associatedwith significant problems in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g. self-esteem, self-direction) and/or interpersonal dysfunction (e.g. ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfyingrelationships, ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships).Accordingly, individuals with these disorders may also meet the diagnostic requirements forpersonality disorder. Generally, individuals with such disorders should not be given an additionaldiagnosis of personality disorder unless additional personality features are present that contributeto significant problems in functioning of aspects of the self or interpersonal functioning. However,even in the absence of these additional features, there may be specific situations in which anadditional diagnosis of personality disorder is warranted (e.g. entry into clinically indicatedforms of treatment that are connected to a personality disorder diagnosis).Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotionsConduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a recurrent pattern of behaviour in whichthe basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules or laws areviolated; this may range in duration from a discrete period lasting a number of months to onethat persists across the lifespan. Conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions isfurther characterized by limited or absent empathy or sensitivity to others’ feelings, and limitedor absent remorse, shame or guilt. Conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotionshas features in common with personality disorder with dissociality, which is characterized bydisregard for the rights and feelings of other, self-centredness and lack of empathy. Conduct-dissocial disorder may be diagnosed among pre-adolescent children, based on a shorter durationof symptoms than personality disorder. Among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, anadditional diagnosis of personality disorder is warranted only if there are personality features inaddition to dissociality that contribute to significant impairments in functioning of aspects of theself or problems in interpersonal functioning.Boundary with secondary personality changeSecondary personality change is a persistent personality disturbance that represents a changefrom the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern that is judged to be a directpathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under mental, behaviouralPersonality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder Personality disorders and related traits 569and neurodevelopmental disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examinationor laboratory findings. Personality disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are due to anothermedical condition.Boundary with disorders due to substance useDisorders due to substance use often have pervasive effects on functioning of the self andinterpersonal functioning. For example, they may exhibit problems with self-direction and self-esteem, difficulties and conflicts in relationships, dissocial behaviour related to obtaining or usingdrugs, and a wide range of other features that are commonly seen in individuals with personalitydisorder. If the personality disturbance is entirely accounted for by a disorder due to substance use,a diagnosis of personality disorder should not be given. However, if the personality disturbance isnot entirely accounted for by the disorder due to substance use (e.g. if the personality disturbancepreceded the onset of substance use) or if there are features of a personality disorder that arenot accounted for by substance use (e.g. perfectionism), an additional diagnosis of personalitydisorder may be assigned.Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder 570 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders Paraphilic disorders 571Paraphilic disordersParaphilic disorders are characterized by persistent and intense patterns of atypical sexual arousal,manifested in sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours, in which the focus of the arousalpattern involves others whose age or status renders them unwilling or unable to consent (e.g.pre-pubertal children, an unsuspecting individual being viewed through a window, an animal).Paraphilic disorders may also involve other atypical sexual arousal patterns if they cause markeddistress to the individual, or may involve significant risk of injury or death.Paraphilic disorders include the following:"

In the absence of a report of the individual’ssexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of other forms of evidence supportingthe presence of a paraphilic arousal pattern include a preference for specific types ofpornography; preference over other forms of sexual behaviour; or planning and repeatedlyseeking out opportunities to engage in the relevant paraphilic sexual behaviour.Boundary with normality (threshold)• Other paraphilic disorder involving non-consenting individuals specifically excludessexual behaviours that occur with the consent of the person or people involved, as long asthey are deemed to have the capacity to provide such consent.Course features• Individuals with paraphilic disorders often report the onset of paraphilic sexual interestduring adolescence.• Paraphilic disorders are relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts,fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual who wasassigned a diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder no longer meets the diagnostic requirements.Developmental presentations• Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasingbehavioural manifestations of paraphilic disorders due to increased impulse control anddecreased sexual drive.Sex- and/or gender-related features• Paraphilic disorders are much more prevalent among men.Paraphilic disorders | Other paraphilic disorder involving non-consenting individuals Paraphilic disorders 587Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorderBoth other paraphilic disorder involving non-consenting individuals and compulsive sexualbehaviour disorder may involve repetitive sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result inmarked distress or impairment.

Methods of fabrication may include falsereporting of symptoms, self-bruising, ingestion of harmful substances and self-injections.Sex- and/or gender-related features• A substantial majority of individuals identified with factitious disorder imposed on selfare female.Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)Boundary with bodily distress disorder and hypochondriasis (healthanxiety disorder)Individuals with bodily distress disorder or hypochondriasis may exaggerate their symptoms attimes to ensure that their care is prioritized or taken seriously, as a part of excessive attentionand treatment-seeking related to somatic symptoms. However, unlike factitious disorder imposedon self, there is no evidence that the person is feigning, falsifying or intentionally inducing oraggravating the symptoms.Boundary with dissociative neurological symptom disorderIn dissociative neurological symptom disorder, symptoms (e.g. seizures, paralysis) are presentedthat are not consistent with neurological findings or other pathophysiology. In contrast tofactitious disorder imposed on self, however, individuals with dissociative neurological symptomdisorder do not feign, falsify or intentionally induce their symptoms.Boundary with malingeringIn malingering, individuals also deceptively report, feign or induce symptoms in order to falsifyor exaggerate the severity of an illness. However, in malingering, primary external incentives areconsidered to be motivating the behaviour. The most common external motives for malingeringinclude evading criminal prosecution, obtaining psychoactive medications (e.g. opioids), avoidingmilitary conscription or dangerous military duty, and attempting to obtain sickness or disabilitybenefits or improvements in living conditions such as housing. Malingering is not considereda mental disorder and is classified in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contactwith health services. In factitious disorder imposed on self, the deceptive behaviour is not solelymotivated by obvious external incentives.Factitious disorders | Factitious disorder imposed on self 596 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersBoundary with other forms of self-injurious behaviourIndividuals who exhibit self-injurious behaviour, often in the context of another mental disorder,may intentionally provide false information to examiners regarding either the self-inducednature of the injuries or the presence of suicidal ideation or intent.

Most dementias are progressive(e.g. dementia due to Alzheimer disease, dementia due to Lewy body disease, frontotemporaldementia), whereas other forms are reversible (e.g. dementia related to nutritional ormetabolic abnormalities), stable (e.g. some cases of dementia due to cerebrovasculardisease) or rapidly progressing (e.g. dementia due to prion disease).Boundary with normality (threshold) for dementia• Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Dementiais differentiated from normal ageing by the severity or magnitude of neurocognitiveimpairment relative to expectations for age, and by functional impairment in everyday skillsand tasks. Deviation from normal ageing can be determined by standardized assessmentusing appropriately normed measures. When cognitive difficulties consistent with normalageing are present and clinically relevant, the symptom code MB21.0 Age-associatedcognitive decline may be used.Course features for dementia• Onset and course of symptoms varies considerably by dementia etiology.

Dementia is more typically characterized byimpairment in specific cognitive skills, and is often progressive and more gradual in onset.Individuals with dementia are at increased risk of delirium, and those who develop acutedisturbances in attention, orientation and awareness should be assigned an additional diagnosisof delirium and evaluated to determine its specific etiology.Boundary with mild neurocognitive disorderDementia is characterized by marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains that is severeenough to cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational orother important areas of functioning. Neurocognitive deficits in mild neurocognitive disordermay be in similar cognitive domains, but are not severe enough to cause significant impairmentin functioning.Boundary with amnestic disorderAmnestic disorder is characterized by prominent memory impairment relative to expectations forage and general level of premorbid neurocognitive functioning, in the absence of other significantneurocognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia is characterized by impairment in two or morecognitive domains, which often but not invariably include memory.Boundary with disorders of intellectual developmentDisorders of intellectual development are characterized by significant limitations in bothintellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, with onset during the developmental period.By convention, cases that meet the diagnostic requirements for disorders of intellectualdevelopment are diagnosed as such unless the neurocognitive impairments are known to be causedby an etiology that is specifically associated with dementia, in which case the dementia diagnosisNeurocognitive disorders | Dementia Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia Neurocognitive disorders 621may be considered.

In cases in which the diagnostic requirements for botha disorder of intellectual development and dementia are met and describe non-redundant aspectsof the clinical presentation, both diagnoses may be assigned.Boundary with mood disordersCognitive concerns and mild measurable cognitive deficits may occur in the context of mooddisorders. These typically improve with appropriate treatment of the corresponding mooddisorder, whereas in dementia neurocognitive impairment is not significantly affected bytreatment of the mood disorder. Standardized assessment or quantified clinical assessment maybe helpful in identifying the presence and objective severity of neurocognitive impairment, whichmay not correspond with an individual’s subjective cognitive complaints.Boundary with factitious disorder and malingeringIn factitious disorder and malingering, the neurocognitive symptoms characteristic of dementiaare consciously feigned.

Most dementias are progressive(e.g. dementia due to Alzheimer disease, dementia due to Lewy body disease, frontotemporaldementia), whereas other forms are reversible (e.g. dementia related to nutritional ormetabolic abnormalities), stable (e.g. some cases of dementia due to cerebrovasculardisease) or rapidly progressing (e.g. dementia due to prion disease).Boundary with normality (threshold) for dementia• Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Dementiais differentiated from normal ageing by the severity or magnitude of neurocognitiveimpairment relative to expectations for age, and by functional impairment in everyday skillsand tasks. Deviation from normal ageing can be determined by standardized assessmentusing appropriately normed measures. When cognitive difficulties consistent with normalageing are present and clinically relevant, the symptom code MB21.0 Age-associatedcognitive decline may be used.Course features for dementia• Onset and course of symptoms varies considerably by dementia etiology. (See additionalinformation below regarding symptom onset and course for dementia due to specificetiologies.)Developmental presentations for dementia• Dementia in children or young adults is rare, and often caused by neuronal ceroidlipofuscinoses, a group of lysosomal storage disorders.• Dementia due to Down syndrome occurs in about 50% or more of individuals with Downsyndrome, and typically emerges after the fourth decade of life.• Risk of dementia increases in older adulthood.Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia 620 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental DisordersCulture-related features for dementia• Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguisticfactors.

Dysthymicdisorder is a chronic and persistent condition, and during the initial period of 2 years necessaryto establish the diagnosis, the number and duration of symptoms are not sufficient to meetthe diagnostic requirements for a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrentdepressive disorder. After this initial period, if the number and severity of symptoms reaches thediagnostic threshold for a depressive episode in the context of an ongoing dysthymic disorder,both dysthymic disorder and either single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressivedisorder may be diagnosed. Unlike dysthymic disorder, recurrent depressive disorder is episodicin nature. However, long periods of subthreshold depressive symptoms that occur followingdepressive episodes when there has not been an initial 2-year period of subthreshold symptomsare better diagnosed as single episode depressive disorder in partial remission or recurrentdepressive disorder in partial remission.Mood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder Mood disorders 253Boundary with mixed depressive and anxiety disorderIndividuals who present with both depressive and anxiety symptoms more days than not fora period of 2 weeks or more, with neither set of symptoms – considered separately – beingsufficiently severe, numerous or lasting to justify a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorderor recurrent depressive disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder may be diagnosed withmixed depressive and anxiety disorder.Boundary with cyclothymic disorderAlthough, in general, depressive periods in cyclothymic disorder are not sufficient to meet thediagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, there may be instances in which the symptomsare severe enough to constitute a depressive episode. In such cases, if there is no history ofhypomanic episodes, single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may bediagnosed, as appropriate, along with cyclothymic disorder.Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disordersIndividuals with single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can exhibitpsychotic symptoms, but these occur only during depressive episodes. Conversely, individualswith a diagnosis of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may experiencesignificant depressive symptoms during psychotic episodes. In such cases, if the depressivesymptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, the depressivemood symptoms specifier may be applied to the psychotic disorder diagnosis. If all diagnosticrequirements for both a depressive episode and schizophrenia are met concurrently or within afew days of each other, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be assigned rather thansingle episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder. However, a diagnosis ofsingle episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can co-occur with a diagnosisof schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned ifthe full diagnostic requirements for each are met, and psychotic symptoms are present outside ofdepressive episodes.Boundary with generalized anxiety disorderGeneralized anxiety disorder and depressive episodes in single episode depressive disorder orrecurrent depressive disorder can share several features, such as somatic symptoms of anxiety,difficulty with concentration, sleep disruption and feelings of dread associated with pessimisticthoughts. Single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder are differentiatedby the presence of low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and othercharacteristic symptoms of a depressive episode (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness,recurrent thoughts of death). In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals are focused on potentialnegative outcomes that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances,work) rather than thoughts of worthlessness or hopelessness. Rumination often occurs in thecontext of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder but, unlike ingeneralized anxiety disorder, is not usually accompanied by persistent worry and apprehensionabout various everyday aspects of life. Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with singleepisode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, but should only be diagnosed ifthe diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to the onset of orfollowing complete remission of a depressive episode.Boundary with other anxiety and fear-related disordersSymptoms of anxiety, including panic attacks, are common in single episode depressive disorderand recurrent depressive disorder, and in some individuals may be a prominent aspect of theclinical presentation. In such cases, the with prominent anxiety symptoms specifier should beapplied to the diagnosis for non-panic anxiety symptoms. If the anxiety symptoms meet thediagnostic requirements for an anxiety or fear-related disorder, the appropriate diagnosis fromthe anxiety and fear-related disorders grouping should also be assigned. For panic attacks, if theseMood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder 254 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disordersoccur entirely in the context of anxiety associated with depressive episodes in single episodedepressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, they are appropriately designated using thewith panic attacks specifier. However, if panic attacks also occur outside of symptomatic moodepisodes and other diagnostic requirements are met, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder shouldbe considered. Both specifiers may be assigned if warranted.Boundary with adjustment disorderAdjustment disorder is characterized by a maladaptive reaction to identifiable psychosocialstressors, and can include depressive symptoms (e.g. rumination), but does not include asufficient number and severity of symptoms to meet the requirements for a depressive episode. Ifthe adjustment reaction meets the diagnostic requirements for single episode depressive disorderor recurrent depressive disorder, even in the presence of identifiable psychosocial stressors, singleepisode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder should be diagnosed rather thanadjustment disorder.Boundary with oppositional defiant disorderIt is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance andsymptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of a mood disorder. Specifically, noncompliance mayresult from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities,difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). Oppositionaldefiant disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, and irritability/anger can be a commonsymptom across these disorders. When the behaviour problems occur primarily in the context ofa depressive episode, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned.However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met,and the behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant disorder are observed outsidethe occurrence of depressive episodes.Boundary with insomniaIndividuals experiencing insomnia may also report depressed mood and may develop otherdepressive symptoms. However, the breadth and severity of symptoms are generally notsufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements for single episode depressive disorder or recurrentdepressive disorder.Boundary with secondary mood syndromeA depressive syndrome that is a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism)should be diagnosed as secondary mood syndrome rather than single episode depressive disorderor recurrent depressive disorder.Boundary with substance-induced mood disorderA depressive syndrome due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervoussystem (e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants), should bediagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder rather than single episode depressive disorder orrecurrent depressive disorder.

A list ofmedical conditions that have been reported to cause psychotic symptoms is included below(p. 659), but the strength of the association varies according to the medical condition. Secondarypsychotic syndrome is often characterized by clinical features that would be atypical for a primarypsychotic disorder such as later age of onset, rapid occurrence of clouding of consciousness, andaccompanying cognitive, neurological or medical symptoms. In secondary psychotic syndrome,disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder) is not typically present, delusions are more oftensimple and fragmented, and hallucinations are more often visual, tactile, olfactory or gustatoryrather than auditory.Boundary with psychotic symptoms that are precipitated by the stress of beingdiagnosed with a medical conditionDepending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, apotentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), being diagnosedwith a severe medical condition can be experienced as a traumatic event, which could trigger thedevelopment of psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations and delusions) in susceptible individuals(e.g. individuals with a pre-existing psychotic disorder, a dissociative disorder or a personalitydisorder). If the psychotic symptoms are part of the presentation of a diagnosable mental disorderthat is judged to be precipitated or exacerbated by the stress of being diagnosed or coping with amedical condition, the appropriate mental disorder (e.g. acute and transient psychotic disorder,post-traumatic stress disorder, recurrent depressive disorder) should be diagnosed rather thansecondary psychotic syndrome.Boundary with delirium due to disease classified elsewhereHallucinations or delusions can occur in the context of delirium due to disease classified elsewhere.Delirium is characterized by disturbed attention (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustainand shift attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment) that developsover a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day, accompanied byother cognitive impairments such as memory deficit, disorientation or impairment in language,visuospatial ability or perception. Disturbed attention and awareness and severe cognitiveimpairment are not features of secondary psychotic syndrome.

This involves first considering whetherany of the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause psychoticsymptoms at the dose and duration at which it has been administered. Second, a temporalrelationship between the medication use and the onset of the psychotic symptoms should beestablished (i.e. the psychotic symptoms began after administration of the medication and/orremitted once the medication was discontinued).

Establishing thepresence of a potentially explanatory medical condition that can cause disturbances of impulsecontrol and the temporal relationship between the medical condition and the disturbances ofimpulse control is critical in diagnosing secondary impulse control syndrome. Compared toimpulse control disorders or disorders due to addictive behaviours, secondary impulse controlsyndrome is more likely to be associated with atypical clinical features, such as a later age of onsetor the presence of disturbances of impulse control in individuals who generally exhibit low levelsof disinhibition or negative emotionality.Boundary with delirium and dementiaDisturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour can occur in the context of delirium ordementia. Secondary impulse control syndrome is characterized by disturbances of impulse controlor addictive behaviours (e.g. aggressive outbursts, compulsive sexual behaviour) occurring in theabsence of severe cognitive impairment. In contrast, delirium is characterized by fluctuating levelsof consciousness and autonomic disturbances, while dementia is characterized by severe memoryimpairment as well as impairments in other domains of cognitive functioning. Disturbances ofimpulse control or addictive behaviour in the context of dementia may be recorded using one ofthe behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia specifiers (e.g. agitation or aggressionin dementia, disinhibition in dementia), if applicable. If the symptoms are judged to be due to thesame medical condition as is causing the dementia, an additional diagnosis of secondary impulsecontrol syndrome is not warranted.Boundary with secondary personality changeDisturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour can occur as part of secondary personalitychange. If the disturbances of impulse control are accompanied by other features of personalitydisturbance that are also judged to be due to a medical condition classified elsewhere, a diagnosisof secondary personality change should be assigned instead.Boundary with disturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour caused bysubstances or medications, including withdrawal effectsWhen establishing a diagnosis of secondary impulse control syndrome, it is important to ruleout the possibility that a medication or substance is causing the symptoms instead of – or inaddition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether any ofthe medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause disturbances ofimpulse control or addictive behaviour at the dose and duration at which it has been administered(e.g. dopamine agonists such as pramipexole for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome).Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use and the onset of the symptomsshould be established (i.e. the symptoms began after administration of the medication and/orremitted once the medication was discontinued).
