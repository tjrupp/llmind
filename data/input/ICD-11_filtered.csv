0,6A00.0,"Disorder of intellectual development, mild","Disorder Name: Disorder of intellectual development, mild
Disorder Code: 6A00.0
Disorder symptoms: A mild disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately two to three standard deviations below the mean (approximately 0.1 – 2.3 percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. Affected persons often exhibit difficulties in the acquisition and comprehension of complex language concepts and academic skills. Most master basic self-care, domestic, and practical activities. Persons affected by a mild disorder of intellectual development can generally achieve relatively independent living and employment as adults but may require appropriate support.
"
1,6A00.1,"Disorder of intellectual development, moderate","Disorder Name: Disorder of intellectual development, moderate
Disorder Code: 6A00.1
Disorder symptoms: A moderate disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately three to four standard deviations below the mean (approximately 0.003 – 0.1 percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. Language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills of persons affected by a moderate disorder of intellectual development vary but are generally limited to basic skills. Some may master basic self-care, domestic, and practical activities. Most affected persons require considerable and consistent support in order to achieve independent living and employment as adults.
"
2,6A00.2,"Disorder of intellectual development, severe","Disorder Name: Disorder of intellectual development, severe
Disorder Code: 6A00.2
Disorder symptoms: A severe disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately four or more standard deviations below the mean (less than approximately the 0.003rd percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests or by comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. Affected persons exhibit very limited language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills. They may also have motor impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care, but may acquire basic self-care skills with intensive training. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd percentile.
"
3,6A00.3,"Disorder of intellectual development, profound","Disorder Name: Disorder of intellectual development, profound
Disorder Code: 6A00.3
Disorder symptoms: A profound disorder of intellectual development is a condition originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately four or more standard deviations below the mean (approximately less than the 0.003rd percentile), based on individually administered appropriately normed, standardized tests or by comparable behavioural indicators when standardized testing is unavailable. Affected persons possess very limited communication abilities and capacity for acquisition of academic skills is restricted to basic concrete skills. They may also have co-occurring motor and sensory impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care. Severe and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 0.003rd percentile.

6,6A01.0,Developmental speech sound disorder,"Disorder Name: Developmental speech sound disorder
Disorder Code: 6A01.0
Disorder symptoms: Developmental speech sound disorder is characterised by difficulties in the acquisition, production and perception of speech that result in errors of pronunciation, either in number or types of speech errors made or the overall quality of speech production, that are outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning and result in reduced intelligibility and significantly affect communication. The errors in pronunciation arise during the early developmental period and cannot be explained by social, cultural, and other environmental variations (e.g., regional dialects). The speech errors are not fully explained by a hearing impairment or a structural or neurological abnormality.

189,6B42,Prolonged grief disorder,"Disorder Name: Prolonged grief disorder
Disorder Code: 6B42
Disorder symptoms: Prolonged grief disorder is a disturbance in which, following the death of a partner, parent, child, or other person close to the bereaved, there is persistent and pervasive grief response characterised by longing for the deceased or persistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness, guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self, an inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social or other activities). The grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following the loss (more than 6 months at a minimum) and clearly exceeds expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s culture and context. Grief reactions that have persisted for longer periods that are within a normative period of grieving given the person’s cultural and religious context are viewed as normal bereavement responses and are not assigned a diagnosis. The disturbance causes significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

The trance state is not characterised by the experience of being replaced by an alternate identity. Trance episodes are recurrent or, if the diagnosis is based on a single episode, the episode has lasted for at least several days. The trance state is involuntary and unwanted and is not accepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during another dissociative disorder and are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder. The symptoms are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, exhaustion, or to hypnagogic or hypnopompic states, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system, head trauma, or a sleep-wake disorder.

Disorder symptoms: Dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning in interacting with others or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life such as parenting, or work, or in response to specific situations (e.g., those that are perceived as threatening). Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor control, and behaviour. There are typically episodes of amnesia, which may be severe. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder.

Disorder symptoms: Partial dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. One personality state is dominant and normally functions in daily life, but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive, affective, perceptual, motor, or behavioural. They are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning, but there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours, such as in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder.

During experiences of depersonalization or derealization, reality testing remains intact. The experiences of depersonalization or derealization do not occur exclusively during another dissociative disorder and are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder. The experiences of depersonalization or derealization are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or to head trauma.

Disorder symptoms: Nocturnal and diurnal enuresis refers to repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed that occurs both during sleep (i.e., during the night) and during waking hours in an individual who has reached a developmental age when urinary continence is ordinarily expected (5 years). The urinary incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bladder control. In most cases, the behaviour is involuntary but in some cases it appears intentional.

244,6C01.0,Encopresis with constipation or overflow incontinence,"Disorder Name: Encopresis with constipation or overflow incontinence
Disorder Code: 6C01.0
Disorder symptoms: Encopresis is the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places occurring repeatedly (e.g., at least once per month over a period of several months) in an individual who has reached the developmental age when faecal continence is ordinarily expected (4 years). The faecal incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bowel control. Encopresis with constipation and overflow incontinence is the most common form of faecal soiling, and involves retention and impaction of faeces. Stools are typically — but not always — poorly formed (loose or liquid) and leakage may range from occasional to continuous. There is often a history of toilet avoidance leading to constipation.

245,6C01.1,Encopresis without constipation or overflow incontinence,"Disorder Name: Encopresis without constipation or overflow incontinence
Disorder Code: 6C01.1
Disorder symptoms: Encopresis is the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places occurring repeatedly (e.g., at least once per month over a period of several months) in an individual who has reached the developmental age when faecal continence is ordinarily expected (4 years). The faecal incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bowel control. Encopresis without constipation and overflow is not associated with retention and impaction of faeces, but rather reflects reluctance, resistance or failure to conform to social norms in defecating in acceptable places in the context of normal physiological control over defecation. Stools are typically of normal consistency and inappropriate defecation is likely to be intermittent.

Disorder Code: 6C20.0
Disorder symptoms: All definitional requirements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is excessive attention to distressing symptoms and their consequences, which may result in frequent medical visits, but the person is not preoccupied with the symptoms (e.g., the individual spends less than an hour per day focusing on them). Although the individual expresses distress about the symptoms and they may have some impact on his or her life (e.g., strain in relationships, less effective academic or occupational functioning, abandonment of specific leisure activities), there is no substantial impairment in the person’s personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Disorder symptoms: Body integrity dysphoria is characterised by an intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. major limb amputee, paraplegic, blind), with onset by early adolescence accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration. The desire to become physically disabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by either the preoccupation with the desire (including time spent pretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with productivity, with leisure activities, or with social functioning (e.g. person is unwilling to have a close relationship because it would make it difficult to pretend) or by attempts to actually become disabled having resulted in the person putting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, by a Disease of the Nervous System or by another medical condition, or by Malingering.

Disorder Code: 6C42.3
Disorder symptoms: Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of synthetic cannabinoids that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of synthetic cannabinoids and their intensity is closely related to the amount of synthetic cannabinoid consumed. They are time-limited and abate as synthetic cannabinoid is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgment, perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception of time), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinary experiences, impaired short-term memory, and sluggishness. Physical signs include conjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes) and tachycardia. Intoxication with synthetic cannabinoids may also cause delirium or acute psychosis.

Disorder symptoms: Synthetic cathinone intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of synthetic cathinones that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of synthetic cathinones and their intensity is closely related to the amount of synthetic cathinones consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the synthetic cathinone is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation (possibly of delusional intensity), transient auditory hallucinations, transitory confusion, and changes in sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesias and dystonias, and skin sores. In rare instances, usually in severe intoxication, use of synthetic cathinones can result in seizures.

666,6D85.2,Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins,"Disorder Name: Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins
Disorder Code: 6D85.2
Disorder symptoms: Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins caused by toxic exposure to specific heavy metals such as aluminium from dialysis water, lead, mercury or manganese. The characteristic cognitive impairments in Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins depend on the specific heavy metal or toxin that the individual has been exposed to but can affect any cognitive domain. Onset of symptoms is related to exposure and progression can be rapid especially with acute exposure. In many cases, symptoms are reversible when exposure is identified and ceases. Investigations such as brain imaging or neurophysiological testing may be abnormal. Lead poisoning is associated with abnormalities on brain imaging including widespread calcification and increased signal on MRI T2-weighted images of periventricular white matter, basal ganglia hypothalamus and pons. Dementia due to aluminium toxicity may demonstrate characteristic paroxysmal high-voltage delta EEG changes.
